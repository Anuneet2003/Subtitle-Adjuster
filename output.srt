2
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,620
How did I survive that?

3
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,400
It was some damn fall.

4
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,840
Oh shit. My comms busted.

5
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,359
My thermals busted too.

6
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,379
I should have got snapped in
half and died on the way down.

7
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,680
Instead of slowly turning
into a meat popsicle.

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Seymour!

9
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,700
Seymour! I'm down here!

10
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,099
Seymour!

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Mickey?

12
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,919
Seymour!

13
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,719
Seymour, I'm down here!

14
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:14,300
Mickey! Whoa!

15
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,460
You haven't died yet?

16
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:17,979
No!

17
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Hold on.

18
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,849
Oh shit!

19
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,580
Your flamethrower's still good.

20
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,830
Not a single scratch.

21
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,165
It's a good thing I thought
to come down here.

22
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,550
Weapons will be happy to see this.

23
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,665
Yeah, I'm gonna turn this in, okay?

24
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:43,689
I can take it.

25
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,210
You're not mad, right?

26
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:47,830
That I'm just taking this?

27
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,150
I mean, it's not looking
very good for you, right?

28
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,651
Also, line only goes this far.

29
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:57,169
Uh-huh.

30
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,250
Yeah, I know.

31
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:01,349
We're cool.

32
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,230
You shouldn't have to take the risk, huh?

33
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,711
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

34
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,290
Plus, they're gonna reprint
you back out tomorrow anyway.

35
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,259
Yeah.

36
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:21,729
Hey, Mickey.

37
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:23,629
Yeah?

38
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,010
What's it feel like to die?

39
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,961
I'm sure you're used to it by now.

40
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:33,919
Still.

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Still.

42
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,830
How many times is this?

43
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,860
You're Mickey 16?

44
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:48,819
17.

45
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,919
Jerk.

46
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,319
18 after this one.

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,199
Well, it's nice knowing you.

48
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,379
Have a nice death.

49
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
See you tomorrow.

50
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,409
Oh, great.

51
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:05,550
Why not?

52
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,919
That's a pretty big one.

53
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:17,060
Hopefully, I'll just get
swallowed in one go.

54
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,740
It's gotta be better than
slowly freezing to death.

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
I guess.

56
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,819
Or maybe not.

57
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,680
But they just printed me
out again every time I died.

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,699
All my data is saved and I
just get a whole new body.

59
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,572
They do all this kind of regular
uploads of memories and

60
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:14,620
my personality traits and
re-implant it back in my brain.

61
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,139
That's some crazy technology, man.

62
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's just say it's advanced.

63
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,750
It's very advanced.

64
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,579
Come on.

65
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Wait.

66
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,379
Just hold on a second.

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,560
Just like, you know, calm down.

68
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:36,040
Just relax.

69
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,420
Breathe.

70
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:36,839
That's right.

71
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:37,939
Breathe.

72
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,154
The whole body printing and memory transplanting thing,
to be honest, was so ridiculously ahead of its time

73
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:56,240
that it caused so many, like, ethical fights and religious
blah blah blah that it was actually banned on Earth.

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,160
And they only allow it now in
outer space for expandables like me.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,261
So from the second we
left the atmosphere, they

76
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:06,740
made me work my ass
off all the way to this planet.

77
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,420
Gave me one mission after another.

78
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,879
Uh, Tech?

79
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,139
What's going on?

80
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,439
The extra cable's here already.

81
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,259
Um, the thing is, Mickey...

82
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,920
Hey, Medical, you wanna tell him?

83
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,339
Tell me what?

84
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,819
Hi, Mickey. How you doing? Um...

85
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,660
Are you experiencing any
vertigo, nausea, or dizziness?

86
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:33,000
Uh, I guess I am feeling a little dizzy.

87
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,220
It's only gonna get worse from
here, Mickey, with a nice fever, too.

88
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,838
Truth is, you're exposed to
unthinkable levels of radiation

89
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,959
right now, which is why we
sent you out in the first place.

90
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Okay.

91
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,995
If you could give us a full
description of your symptoms.

92
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:52,560
So, a couple things I wanna go
through on our cosmic radiation checklist.

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,800
First, how long until
your skin starts to bleed?

94
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,920
Then, how long until you go blind?

95
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,560
And of course, how long until you die?

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,620
That's the real nut we're after.

97
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,199
There was this one time in my fourth grade
science class, I messed with a lab frog.

98
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,160
I just figured this all
must be my punishment.

99
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,680
Mickey, take off your glove so I can see
what's happening under your space suit.

100
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,509
Oh! Oh!

101
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,790
Wow! Did you see that?

102
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
Good morning.

103
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,089
Good morning.

104
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,899
Keep yourself hydrated, Mickey.

105
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,959
You'll start to feel extremely parched.

106
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,360
Arkady, I think the dose was too high.

107
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,079
Who cares, Dorothy?
He's gonna be dead in ten minutes.

108
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,120
Just focus on getting
all the blood samples.

109
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,860
He's gonna bleed through his
eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and rectum.

110
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,000
Make sure to collect separate
samples from everyone.

111
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,879
Okay? And keep the memory
upload going at the same time.

112
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,039
This Mickey's special.
You know that, right?

113
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,240
Out of all the Mickeys, you
will have the shortest life span.

114
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,279
I heard.

115
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,139
Terminus.

116
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,019
Well, aren't you any good news?

117
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,700
Smaller than 15. Much better, isn't it?

118
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,936
I would have been filthy rich
by now with life insurance,

119
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:55,059
except I have obviously
expendables or uninsurance.

120
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:59,899
There's no workers' comp,
no unions, no pension benefits.

121
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,368
Now, I wouldn't be surprised
if you were thinking at

122
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:06,480
this point, well, then why
did you do this to yourself?

123
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,238
Well, because I had a
friend who told me that

124
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,100
one day macarons would
sell better than burgers.

125
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,224
And because I trusted
this shitty friend and I

126
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:25,879
got an enormous loan from a wonderful
gentleman to open a macaron store.

127
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,039
All right, all right, calm down.

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,159
I'm well aware that
you have four weeks left.

129
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,200
Just think of this
as a little field trip.

130
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,960
Taste of what may unfold should you
fail to reimburse us in a timely manner.

131
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,799
Besides, you two have a
lot of time on your hands.

132
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,919
With your little macaron shop gone under.

133
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,440
Woo! This is, uh, this is quite a show.

134
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,450
You got on here for me. Quite a show.
The message is clear. I hear you.

135
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:26,590
I hear it loud and clear. I'm late.
I'm late. The money is late. It's coming.

136
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,419
Darius Blank.
A name I wish I'd never heard.

137
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:35,799
Mr. Blank is no less concerned with money.
He has plenty.

138
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,629
This building is just
one of his many assets.

139
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,041
Watching his delinquent
borrowers die, savoring

140
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:45,919
the details of death,
that he truly enjoys.

141
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,035
The message is clear. You can stop now.
We can stop. You know, it's, it's, it's...

142
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,919
I hear you. Two, you
know, two weeks, uh,

143
00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:53,940
two weeks is all it
takes. All it takes now.

144
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:57,600
And, and, and, and, more time.
More time. More money. More money.

145
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,159
Who caught that gentleman four
days ago at Ulaanbaatar? Mongolian?

146
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Looks expensive.

147
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,937
Best assured, anyone
who misses the deadline,

148
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:19,279
we chase them to
the ends of the Earth.

149
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,120
So we decided to get off of Earth.

150
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,659
Nothing was working out,
and I got no family lying on me.

151
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,863
So I applied to the colony
expedition, but there's,

152
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,100
like, a million other
people with the same idea.

153
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Seems like the whole of this rotten
planet was running away from something.

154
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,679
I guess everybody's got money problems.

155
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,600
But anyway, we had to get on this ship,
because it was the last one of the season.

156
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,879
Waves upon waves of people
desperate to leave Earth.

157
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:53,059
It's clear anti-migrationists are
talking to a brick wall when they insist...

158
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,519
...on fixing up the Earth instead of risking
lives by migrating to another planet.

159
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:03,340
It feels like these passionate
applicants are already off in space.

160
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,653
More importantly, this
is the expedition led

161
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,139
by former Congressman
Kenneth Marshall...

162
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,500
...who lost his last two elections.

163
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,100
Is this failed politician now trying to
establish a kingdom beyond the stars?

164
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,960
Is it his fanatical supporters who
won him a generous sponsorship...

165
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:25,120
...from a particular religious
organization and corporation?

166
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,139
So many questions left unanswered.

167
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,659
Let's go and talk to the crowd.

168
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,299
Excuse me, are you a
Kenneth Marshall supporter?

169
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:34,620
I am. I am. Big time.

170
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,259
I am a full-on supporter.
I basically am the one and only.

171
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,620
Are you from Marshall's official channel?

172
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,159
No way!
So Marshall's watching this right now?

173
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,379
Oh, my God!

174
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,860
You need to pick me.
I swear. Please, pick me.

175
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:50,500
You need people young and healthy...

176
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,440
...and gentlemen, we have
another wild sandstorm today.

177
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,799
Access is now restricted to game three.

178
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,980
Please visit our stand for
discounted goggles and masks.

179
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,360
Additional 5% off with
Marshall Pay, as always.

180
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,860
The other expeditions wouldn't
take me, but they're wrong.

181
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,840
I promise I can fix toilets.
I make gingerbreads.

182
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:11,280
You've got to take me, Commissioner.

183
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:22,649
Expendable.

184
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:25,090
You're applying to be an expendable?

185
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,870
Seriously?

186
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,620
You read through the whole application?

187
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:32,789
Uh, yeah.

188
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,429
I should have read through it.

189
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,350
I mean, I didn't have too much of a choice.

190
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,610
I don't have any bona fide certifications.

191
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,769
I don't really have any skills whatsoever.

192
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,424
But then I find out
Timo's already called dibs

193
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:52,830
on a position for
himself as a flitter pilot.

194
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,370
He only just got his learner's
permit a couple of weeks before.

195
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,529
No idea what he had to
come up with to pull that off.

196
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:02,815
But you've got to give it to him.

197
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:04,809
Excuse me.

198
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,789
Is there, like, some construction going on?

199
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:11,169
Sorry, what?

200
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:13,309
I don't hear like a...

201
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,769
like a chainsaw.

202
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,429
Uh, no.

203
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,500
I want it to get the hell out of there.

204
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,669
Somewhere where the
sound couldn't follow me.

205
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:27,909
Far out into space.

206
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:31,889
You read through the paperwork?

207
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:33,389
Yes.

208
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,190
You read it, so you know, right,
this is gonna be a pretty extreme job.

209
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:40,169
But it's also gonna be... fun.

210
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,529
I'll explain all the details.

211
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,549
I got so distracted by that smell.

212
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,929
Uh, the smell of this woman's hair.

213
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:52,370
It was like it brought back some
faraway memory or something.

214
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,610
That giant tank downstairs
is called a cycler.

215
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,549
It takes organic waste
produced in the spaceship.

216
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,850
Apple peels, chicken bones, rotten eggs,
dead bodies, human waste, you name it.

217
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,129
Then it combines,
refines and recycles them.

218
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,950
And sends a portion to this printer.

219
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,730
Raw materials for a human body.

220
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,083
Once you die and the
committee approves, it'll

221
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,509
print a new version of
your body within 20 hours.

222
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:24,659
Take your clothes off.

223
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:25,945
Change into this.

224
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,690
I couldn't even hear
anything she was saying.

225
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,029
It was like all my senses
were focused on my nose.

226
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,889
Like real deja vu, but for a smell.

227
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,309
We're going to do a
full scan of your bio data.

228
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,590
That means you'll be reprinted
exactly as you are right now.

229
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:48,309
Forever.

230
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,509
I better pop this.

231
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,850
Otherwise it'll be there every time.

232
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,679
Well, I'm glad she didn't
know about the one on my butt.

233
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,259
So after she does the body
scan, she uploaded my memories.

234
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,980
Call it a personality backup.

235
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,727
And I gotta do this
once a week so I don't

236
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,179
have any big gaps every
time they print me out.

237
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,519
In the past, you would have
needed a hard drive the size

238
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:23,179
of a commercial refrigerator
to copy an adult brain.

239
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,029
Now this little brick.

240
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Clever, right?

241
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,100
So I was injected with
some special solution.

242
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,919
It brought back a flood of old memories.

243
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,200
Too many memories.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We were heading home from the supermarket.

245
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,960
And I asked to sit in the front seat.

246
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,000
I said, I'm big enough.

247
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,419
And that's when I saw the red button.

248
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,379
And I just pressed it and she crashed.

249
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,500
Put it to your head and pull the trigger.

250
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,279
This is the final requirement
to become an expendable.

251
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,400
Prove to me you have faith in this system.

252
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,329
From now on you need to get used to dying.

253
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,519
This is your job.

254
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:09,269
I began the four and a half
year journey as Mickey One.

255
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,140
When you're stuck in a spaceship
for that long, food is everything.

256
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:21,440
Warning, Mickey One.

257
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:24,880
Seven calories over the
current ration allocation.

258
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
On that first day in the cafeteria,

259
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,099
I think I might have started thinking,

260
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,619
what have I done?

261
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:45,460
A little.

262
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:48,799
The whole room was full of
people eating this crappy food.

263
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,000
And there's total silence.

264
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,559
Like you could hear a pin drop.

265
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:58,299
Until Kenneth Marshall...
and his wife, Ilfa, walk in.

266
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,759
And a whole bunch of
people just started going nuts.

267
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,960
I was thinking, what
the hell am I doing here?

268
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,680
But that's when I saw her.

269
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Nasha.

270
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,480
That was the first time
I saw Nasha Barrage.

271
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:38,160
On day one of this long journey.

272
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,059
Keep that up for one...

273
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:46,730
That's two percent of the precious
meal you're eating right now.

274
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,542
As you know, our number
one priority is to conserve

275
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:53,470
food resources until
our arrival at Niflheim.

276
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,130
So that we maximize our survival rate.

277
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:57,329
So listen up.

278
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,430
Sexual intercourse, for example.

279
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:05,970
Each session consumes
a whopping 100 calories.

280
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,069
At least.

281
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:12,589
Depending on the participant's
duration times friction equals...

282
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,990
The point is, Kenneth is
talking to the committee

283
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,750
about banning all
sexual activity on the ship.

284
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:30,059
Are you sure this is the
right time to bring that up?

285
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,380
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

286
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:36,799
It's okay, Ilfa.

287
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:38,799
Am I doing okay?

288
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:40,400
Should I go harder?

289
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,839
Yes, yes. Go hard.

290
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,079
All right.

291
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:45,500
Fellow pioneers.

292
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:50,400
Once we've arrived at Niflheim and
we've secured our food production,

293
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:56,380
we will launch the greatest sex
encouragement campaign in history.

294
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,160
You will spread your
seed across the planet.

295
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,839
Even when it's restrictive,
you will always seafood.

296
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,819
NOW.

297
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,359
Formigating.

298
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,940
calidad to you.

299
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:22,500
Início.

300
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,900
God bless um...

301
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,059
God bless...

302
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:41,119
God bless...

303
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,539
Those four years would have
felt like 40 if it weren't for Nasha.

304
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:05,059
She stayed with me in the best of times...
and kept by my side in the worst of times.

305
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,829
Not everyone gets lucky
enough to find a soulmate like this.

306
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,960
None of this would have happened
if I'd never boarded this spaceship.

307
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,130
So all hail the great
loan shark, Darius Blank.

308
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:24,805
Thanks, Darius.

309
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,445
But it wasn't like I was slack, you know.

310
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,390
I was super busy every
day taking care of Nasha.

311
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:33,190
She's an all-in-one elite agent.

312
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,416
And it's not easy
supporting someone who's a

313
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,250
soldier, a police
officer, and a firefighter.

314
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,990
But what she sees in me, I got no idea.

315
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:44,609
I'm just grateful.

316
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:50,750
But as soon as I step out the door,
the ship was filled with mostly dickheads.

317
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,390
Hey, Mickey, right?

318
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:55,990
Can we just ask?

319
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:00,490
What's it like to die?

320
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,089
You know, when you're reprinted?

321
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,710
Now, how does that feel?

322
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,589
Oh, come on, just tell us.
We really want to know.

323
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,450
Imagine spending years
elbow to elbow with these bozos.

324
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:15,575
It was enough to push anyone over the edge.

325
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,589
Sometimes even if
Nasha, who is a model

326
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:22,630
citizen, would have to
step in and remind us...

327
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:25,250
...that we were all one big happy family.

328
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,289
There to help one another.

329
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,190
There to have each other's backs.

330
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,890
A tight-knit, harmonious community.

331
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:40,710
...and the committee
has written about this.

332
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,630
Hey, Mickey.

333
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:47,670
You must be hungry. Have some more.

334
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,990
Uh, thanks, Kai.

335
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,150
Can you change your shampoo?

336
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:56,589
Shampoo?

337
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,509
There's only one shampoo in
this entire space. Thank you.

338
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,529
It was a very long trip
in a beautiful community.

339
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:06,109
Hi.

340
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,450
But, uh, Nasha was obviously
my one and only, you know.

341
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:14,890
For real.

342
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:22,509
And as for my one and
only job, I was proud of it.

343
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,730
I felt like I was part of the team.

344
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,130
Be careful.

345
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:30,269
Patty!

346
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:43,390
Travelers... And
sisters... And sisters...

347
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:48,369
It is long that we have caught
four years together in this ship...

348
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:51,990
...and that we love you
like our very own family.

349
00:25:52,430 --> 00:26:00,430
And here we are right below us
awaits our very own planet of purity...

350
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:05,950
What's fucking wrong with him?
It's fine, aren't it?

351
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,910
Maybe we have some glue or something.

352
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,009
Like a virgin vanilla ice cream.

353
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,730
Touched for the very first time.

354
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:18,230
It's gonna be really cold.

355
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:21,769
Whoever's gone down there
first is gonna freeze to death.

356
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,710
And then, make easy
breaths, fill your lungs,

357
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:33,289
and you're sucking in every single
microscopic particle floating around.

358
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,109
All the viruses.

359
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,410
Fill every avioli.

360
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,490
So good?

361
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:45,555
Oh, so good!

362
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,750
Brilliant.

363
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,990
There really was an
unknown virus in the air.

364
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,130
A lethal one.

365
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,420
So fucking warm.

366
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm fine.

367
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:10,839
In the end, thanks to the lab
rats Mickey 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16

368
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,779
getting stabbed, gasped, dumped,
and burned, we got the vaccine.

369
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:17,160
My great gift to mankind.

370
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,900
And so, we didn't need oxygen masks,

371
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:23,569
and we could see our
breath as much as we wanted.

372
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,640
Look at that, Jennifer. Ridiculous.

373
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,375
I can't believe we
still live in that thing.

374
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
I know, right?

375
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,799
Planfall was ages ago.

376
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,319
And we're still eating the
same crappy in-flight TV dinner.

377
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,900
Precisely why we ought to
build residential complexes.

378
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,299
You know, grow crops as soon as possible.

379
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,039
Yeah, sure.

380
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,220
You know, spread the seed.

381
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,359
Infest the land.

382
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
Propagate the species.

383
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
It's freezing.

384
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,369
Whoa.

385
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,890
Look at that color.

386
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,490
Yeah.

387
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,549
It's beautiful.

388
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:13,609
Oh.

389
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,430
Oh.

390
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:16,849
Oh.

391
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:18,410
He's such a klutz.

392
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,299
You should learn some Breakfall moves.

393
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:20,650
You okay?

394
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:22,069
Yeah, I'm fine.

395
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,190
Come on.

396
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:27,849
What's Breakfall?

397
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,680
What is it?

398
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:09,569
Come on, Mickey, let's go!

399
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Go, go, go, go!

400
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,880
Mickey, Mickey, it's Marshall.

401
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,960
You fucking useless little asshole.

402
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,019
You're an expendable.

403
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,519
You're here to be expended.

404
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,000
Damn it!

405
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:39,579
I'm so sorry.

406
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:44,400
And why is Jennifer Chilton, a
precious, fertile female, dead and not you?

407
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:46,299
How do you train us?

408
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,299
You know?

409
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:47,700
Fuck you.

410
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:48,160
Fuck you.

411
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,779
That's what I want to know.

412
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:50,819
Disgusting.

413
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:51,819
Really?

414
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,079
You don't like my sauce?

415
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:54,819
No, no, no, no, darling.

416
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,059
Those things.

417
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,779
Look at them.

418
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
What the fuck's going on?

419
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,279
They're delicious, aren't they?

420
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:01,635
Oh, for some reason, I like it.

421
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,140
Hey, you.

422
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,000
Stand still.

423
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,079
Don't move.

424
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:06,539
They lust.

425
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,259
For humans.

426
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,500
God.

427
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
You're a body of flesh.

428
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Creepy.

429
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,859
Oh, honey.

430
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,039
That's perfect.

431
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,300
We should call them creepers.

432
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,325
I'll call them creepers.

433
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,339
I'm calling them creepers.

434
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,829
Preston, are you listening?

435
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,321
Expendable, I've decided
in the committee that

436
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:28,681
going forward, your
rations will be halved.

437
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:33,708
So, my shift doubled,
14 hours every day, seven

438
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:37,701
days a week, until I brought
home a creeper sample.

439
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,319
How did I survive that?

440
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,920
What's it feel like to die?

441
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,450
Even on my 17th
go-round, I really hate dying.

442
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:05,190
Still. Always.

443
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
Bon appétit.

444
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,019
Where am I? What's going on?
I'm not coming out of the printer.

445
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,319
I'm still 17.

446
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,500
Why didn't that thing eat me?

447
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,180
I was passed out.

448
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,079
Did I not look tasty enough?

449
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,420
Oh, I've got it.
They're saving me for their kiddos.

450
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,210
What a great mom.

451
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,500
Oh, please just make it quick.

452
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:05,220
Come on, guys. Big bites. Big bites.

453
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,340
Ow!

454
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,199
Where are you taking me now?

455
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Ow!

456
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,280
Has my meat gone bad
after all that reprinting?

457
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,300
I'm still good meat!

458
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:54,880
I'm perfectly good meat!

459
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,389
I taste fine!

460
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,519
...

461
00:34:58,619 --> 00:34:59,619
...

462
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
...

463
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:04,719
... ...

464
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,380
...

465
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:19,260
...ditching me out here
in the middle of nowhere...

466
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:23,099
...it's not cool!

467
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:27,380
...that rock is, are you blind? You can't
just have the other bat feuds through here!

468
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,860
Science requested it, so
don't give me shit about it!

469
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,159
You try to jam it in and scratch anywhere
on this date, my date, it's on you!

470
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,331
On me? How? Blame the
guys in science. They cut into

471
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:41,500
this site, but I got specific
orders to bring it as is!

472
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:45,380
I don't fucking care, okay? Through the
meeting over there, I can't reach them.

473
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,701
I'm not taking the fall for
this. Every time you come in

474
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:51,599
here, my gate, gate 3, you
act like you own the place.

475
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,460
Why would I wanna own this shit already?

476
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,860
You should shut the fuck up, okay?

477
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,420
You know what? You need to get laid.

478
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,059
Fuck you!

479
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:57,360
...you need to get laid. Fuck you!

480
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:58,500
Fuck you!

481
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,760
Oh damn, Nicky!
Didn't expect to see you out there today.

482
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,079
Wait, is that the time?

483
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,059
It's 3.30?

484
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,559
...it doesn't really make any sense.

485
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,480
...Do you remember what?
Do you remember when I left?!

486
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:19,599
What did you say?

487
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
...razón!

488
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:24,920
...shut it off!

489
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:25,539
...the maze!

490
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,860
...the switch!

491
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:43,045
It's that time again, the
dinner of your dreams,

492
00:37:43,056 --> 00:37:46,079
with Kenneth Marshall,
who will be this month's

493
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:49,123
lucky guest of honour.
A grand surprise awaits.

494
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:52,059
Hang onto your ship,
because the dove of luck

495
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,460
just might come fluttering its wings with
an invitation for you. From Dove with Love,

496
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
over and out.

497
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
What is this?

498
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:45,619
Why aren't you dead?

499
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:52,900
Oh God, oh God, oh God. No, no, no, no.
18? They printed you out today?

500
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:55,965
What the fuck is going
on? According to Timo, you

501
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:59,280
should be sliding out on one of those
creeper's assholes right about now.

502
00:38:59,735 --> 00:39:00,896
You have to put it like that?

503
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,840
Oh God, I'm completely fucked.

504
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,679
What do you mean?

505
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:10,539
We're multiples.

506
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,940
I gotta kill you.

507
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Kill me?

508
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,541
I mean, you should probably
kill yourself if one of us has to die.

509
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:37,579
It's been, like, two hours since I
was printed. I've barely had a life.

510
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,099
Well, I was never dead. So you don't count.
Go back to the cyclone!

511
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:49,920
Multiples. Where do I even begin?

512
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,766
Mankind is not equipped to
deal with the legal and ethical

513
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:56,780
implications of adopting this
human printing technology.

514
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Please tell me.

515
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,579
Can any of you honestly guarantee
that the technology will not be abused?

516
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,059
No one in their R&D department
could come up with a convincing answer.

517
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:13,795
But the real problem was
that one of the brains behind

518
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,780
human printing turned out
to be a certified psychopath.

519
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,199
Helen Manikova.

520
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:22,889
I think it's him.

521
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
Are you sure?

522
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,300
There was this series of particularly
brutal murders targeting homeless people.

523
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,519
And only one eyewitness account.

524
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,719
But it matched Alan
Manikova's appearance to a tee.

525
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,360
The cops thought they had their man,
except Manikova had a surefire alibi.

526
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:41,534
At the time of the
murder, he was getting his

527
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:43,246
makeup done for a
children's science show.

528
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,760
But the cops had his number.

529
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:55,599
When they raided Manikova's house, they
brought two sets of handcuffs and warrants.

530
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,110
They were on to him.

531
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,800
Or rather, they were on to them.

532
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,519
Which one's Manikova Prime?

533
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,380
You?

534
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Or you?

535
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:07,460
Yep, there were two.

536
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:10,159
One for the murder, and one for the alibi.

537
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:14,480
Manikova had printed another
Manikova without the company knowing.

538
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,460
So here's a question for you.

539
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,579
Are they accomplices, or did
one act under the other's orders?

540
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:26,559
Are these separate and independent crimes,
or were they one person from the get-go?

541
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:29,199
They only get half portions in jail, or...

542
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,699
they get a full meal each.

543
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:35,579
Police, legal experts,
philosophers, everyone was stumped.

544
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:40,460
But while Manikova One and Two were
both locked up in an interrogation room,

545
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,780
another homeless man was brutally murdered.

546
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:47,500
Lo and behold, Manikova Three.

547
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:59,565
I think it was some cheap
tabloid reporter who called

548
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:02,820
them multiples, or some
professor or something.

549
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:04,659
Whoever came up with it, it stuck.

550
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,679
And pretty soon the word
multiples spread fear and contempt.

551
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:12,659
So multiples are an abomination.

552
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,681
They destroy the natural order.

553
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,440
Each soul shall only have one body.

554
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:18,679
Right?

555
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,500
One soul, one body.

556
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:24,619
The Lord, he only blesses
this one-to-one union.

557
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,300
But former Congressman Marshall
does have a point worth considering.

558
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,119
It would be a shame.

559
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:34,840
Not to explore the potential
application of this advanced technology.

560
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,900
I was happy to receive an
invitation from this committee.

561
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,840
You were subpoenaed, Mr. Marshall?

562
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,099
Sure, sure.

563
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:50,280
In any case, I want to take this opportunity
to speak as an expedition commander.

564
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,239
Human printing is a sin.

565
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,199
Multiples are Satan's work.

566
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,541
However, I've been
contemplating how can we use

567
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:06,079
this abomination for our
common economic benefit.

568
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:14,739
I propose a trial run of human printing far
from Earth under the strictest oversight,

569
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:19,190
limiting such individuals
to one per expedition

570
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:22,519
per planet under the
designation expendable.

571
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,960
Multiples, in the case of multiples,

572
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,159
we exterminate every offending individual,

573
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:37,059
in totality, mind and body, all
for the sake of public service.

574
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,976
On this Niflheim
expedition, all multiples will

575
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:45,059
immediately be arrested,
executed and permanently deleted.

576
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:50,579
Oh, man.

577
00:43:53,315 --> 00:43:55,519
What the hell is this guy?

578
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,059
Nasha told me that Mickey
3 was whiny and clingy,

579
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:06,579
5 was indecisive and apparently 8
was pretty annoying and kind of stupid,

580
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,179
but none of them were complete nut jobs.

581
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,860
Even this lunatic is scared
of being a multiple, though.

582
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,760
That's permanent deletion.

583
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:20,219
Trying to trash me in the cycler.

584
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,019
If one of us has to go...

585
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,219
it ain't gonna be me.

586
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,650
We can split the workload, too.

587
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,429
And we can take turns dying.

588
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:19,809
You're 18, so you can take even numbers,
and I'll just cover 19, 21 and odd numbers.

589
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,710
Are you afraid to die?

590
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,590
Kinda, yeah.

591
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,230
You've died plenty of times.

592
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:28,110
What are you so scared of?

593
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:32,510
Until now, I died
and... I was just...

594
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:33,889
born again.

595
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,130
You know?

596
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:39,090
It felt like it was me, continuing on.

597
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:40,929
But now...

598
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,869
once I die...

599
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:47,250
it'll be over for me.

600
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,349
It'll be you living on.

601
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,269
You get what I mean?

602
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,360
I don't like you.

603
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:06,179
You're such a little bitch.

604
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:08,239
But I'm you.

605
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,840
I'm not you.

606
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,440
I'm not gonna live like you.

607
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,179
I'm gonna kill you!

608
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:40,690
What the fuck, man?

609
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:41,891
Are you trying to get noticed?

610
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:44,349
They don't even have cameras.

611
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:45,530
Take that off, you dumbass.

612
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:46,929
Amateur.

613
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,230
Your first time.

614
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:49,329
No, no.

615
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,001
This is the pure stuff, right?

616
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,690
Undiluted?

617
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,300
Who do you think you're talking to?

618
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:57,309
This...

619
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,329
is pure uncut oxy.

620
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:02,349
It's fucking rare.

621
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,349
You only get two oxyzulfocapsules
and one flamethrower, man.

622
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,911
... ...

623
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,170
...

624
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:22,969
...

625
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,751
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

626
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:30,269
...

627
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:39,070
... ... ... Wait. Fact-checking.

628
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,110
Have fun, man.

629
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:42,869
Let's kill him.

630
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,070
Are you crazy?

631
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:47,150
He's like my only friend.

632
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:48,929
Forever.

633
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,489
Same warfare as this meat shit.

634
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:51,869
Wait, wait, wait.

635
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,570
Demo!

636
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,690
Mickey, what?

637
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,340
Looks like business is blowing up, huh?

638
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:00,971
What are you talking about?

639
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:03,309
Another junkie coming in.

640
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:07,369
Hey!

641
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,690
Are you mental?

642
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:22,909
Wait till I get out of
here or I'll kill you!

643
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:23,989
What the fuck is this?

644
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:26,829
Come down lower!

645
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,070
You fucking idiot!

646
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,309
Mickey, help me.

647
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,510
What is that?

648
00:48:55,764 --> 00:48:57,085
Why is it so red? That looks hot.

649
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,210
What are you doing?

650
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,230
I want you to have a car dying.

651
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,139
You son of a bitch.

652
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,750
What?

653
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,650
Come on!

654
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,750
Stop!

655
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:10,889
Stop!

656
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,210
Shh, shh, shh.

657
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:25,239
Who's that, Mickey?

658
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:27,309
Hey, what's going on?

659
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:29,190
Mickey, what are you doing here?

660
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:32,400
Uh, Demo accidentally fell in.

661
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,460
But, uh... he's alright now.

662
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:37,019
I wanna keep dealing, motherfucker.

663
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,579
Watch what you say.

664
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,019
What happened?

665
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:45,639
You okay?

666
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,590
What's up with your hand?

667
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
Uh...

668
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,340
I was taking out the trash
and I tripped into the hole.

669
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:56,726
I would have been a
goner if not for Mickey.

670
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,980
I almost became a cyclodust.

671
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,039
Hey.

672
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:01,619
You alright?

673
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,561
Don't you stay in bed. It's only been
a few hours since you were printed.

674
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,559
Yeah, I should have died.

675
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,599
You heard the rumor?

676
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,880
Huh?

677
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,380
Some guy out there is
dealing undiluted oxytocin.

678
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:12,900
What?

679
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,400
That's crazy. That's pretty messed up.

680
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,014
Between us, Timo?

681
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:19,739
A drop here and there before
bed to take the edge off?

682
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,860
I get it.

683
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:23,219
But the pure uncut
stuff is crossing the line.

684
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,380
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

685
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:25,659
That's... bad.

686
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:29,099
Nasha, take Mickey home. I'll wrap up here.

687
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,320
Yes.

688
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:31,860
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

689
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,030
Today I feel like... B6.

690
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:52,110
B6?

691
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,110
Yeah.

692
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:54,489
Flying Nasha.

693
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,909
It's definitely my place for now.

694
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,150
It's alright.

695
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:05,369
B6.

696
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,010
B6 was ours, Nasha.

697
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,900
Mickey?

698
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:20,769
Hey, brother.

699
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,695
I was just headed to your room to catch
you, but here you are. Looking good, Mickey.

700
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:25,719
Yes, sir.

701
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,820
Stand there.

702
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,940
Arm around, please.

703
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:29,420
Great.

704
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,300
Big smile, Mickey.

705
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,079
Sorry. Could you just stand there?

706
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,159
Great. Thank you.

707
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:38,579
And action.

708
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:40,239
Congratulations.

709
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:42,235
This month's lucky winner,

710
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:46,400
the fortunate soul who will have the
privilege of a private dinner at the camera,

711
00:51:46,489 --> 00:51:50,039
will have a private dinner with the
one and only Kenneth Marshall is...

712
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,059
Is that the barrel?

713
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,800
It's Mickey.

714
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,239
Great. Big smile. Smile.

715
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,260
Yeah. Amazing.

716
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,000
Okay, cut.

717
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:00,340
Now, Marshall wants you to come ASAP, okay?

718
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,440
He's got a whole feast
prepared just for you.

719
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,559
The Lord is truly blessing
you today, Mickey.

720
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:07,865
I need to go back to my room.

721
00:52:07,889 --> 00:52:09,610
You get to stuff your fucking face, Mickey.

722
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,119
I bet that freak is probably

723
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:17,061
drooling all over my
beautiful Nasha already.

724
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,380
It's disgusting.

725
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:21,920
What's even more
disgusting is that I'm drooling

726
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,840
at the thought of the tenderloin
steak I ordered for Marshall's dinner.

727
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:28,260
This is so wrong!

728
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:30,860
So glad you seem to be enjoying it.

729
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,780
How's the sauce?

730
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:37,099
Oh.

731
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,280
Oh, sorry, sorry. Please.

732
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:40,559
Continue.

733
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,380
Yeah, yeah, Mickey, uh,

734
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,659
listen, going back to everything that

735
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:47,320
happened with, uh...

736
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,840
Jennifer?

737
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,599
Yes, Jennifer.

738
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,030
Jennifer, uh...

739
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,500
I know, I know.

740
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,880
When we lost our
dear Jennifer Chilton,

741
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,599
I may have gotten a little

742
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,798
angry and said some
terribly unkind things.

743
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,079
I know it's late, and
I want to apologize.

744
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,536
Oh, he's always like this.

745
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:11,760
Such an adorable

746
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,840
man, and then suddenly he's all cutthroat.

747
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,940
Sorry.

748
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:21,960
You're still squishy,
fresh out of the printer.

749
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:23,820
Continue feeding him.

750
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:29,539
Oh, anyway, we have
another special guest here.

751
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,639
Hi, Kai.

752
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:32,489
Sorry I'm late.

753
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,070
You look very nice.

754
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:34,840
Thank you.

755
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Come, come.

756
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:36,980
It's good to see you.

757
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,079
Sit.

758
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:42,039
You okay, emotionally?

759
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,250
Yeah, I feel fine, sir.

760
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,559
Thank you.

761
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:46,420
I'm glad to hear it, Kai.

762
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,260
I'm so sorry about Jennifer.

763
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,059
I hear you were extremely close,

764
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,610
your best friend.

765
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,880
But I knew you'd stay
strong throughout the long.

766
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,320
Thank you, ma'am.

767
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,880
But we didn't invite you
here simply to comfort you.

768
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:03,940
We've had our eyes on you, Cass.

769
00:54:04,485 --> 00:54:05,467
Me, sir?

770
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:08,121
May I ask why?

771
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,380
You're one of us.

772
00:54:12,175 --> 00:54:14,840
With your impeccable
genetics, you are the perfect

773
00:54:15,114 --> 00:54:17,860
specimen for the
colony I envision.

774
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,260
Thank you, sir.

775
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:23,139
That's why the church,

776
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,719
I mean, um, company,

777
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,639
has chosen me to lead this expedition.

778
00:54:28,659 --> 00:54:29,739
The Earth's beyond saving

779
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:31,159
with all its muddied people.

780
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:32,800
But you,

781
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,670
you're something special,

782
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,679
and I'm creating a world

783
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,480
on a pure white planet

784
00:54:38,704 --> 00:54:42,159
full of superior
people like you and us.

785
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,356
Isn't that right, darling?

786
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,079
Yes. It's his vision,

787
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,679
his sensibilities.

788
00:54:48,014 --> 00:54:49,014
But let's be honest.

789
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,860
With your medical records in hand,

790
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,539
you ran to join our expedition

791
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:54,559
instead of one of those pathetic

792
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,079
planets where they plant microchips

793
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,920
in their artificially
inseminated baby embryos.

794
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:03,840
You really are the perfect candidate for
Niflheim's natural child birthing program,

795
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,960
aren't you, dear?

796
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,480
Mr. Marshall,

797
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:09,639
am I just a uterus to you?

798
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:15,179
No! No, no, no, no, no.

799
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,119
Oh, it's nothing like that.

800
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:17,900
Kai, no.

801
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
This man is not one to objectify women.

802
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,920
All my husband means to say

803
00:55:22,269 --> 00:55:24,119
is he has very high standards.

804
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:29,059
His only dream is of a planet
exclusively for a pure human race.

805
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,139
That consumes real crops

806
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:32,489
and real meat

807
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:35,199
and dinners with delicate,

808
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,360
delicious sauces.

809
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,860
Oh, sauce is the true
litmus test of civilization.

810
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:42,659
People who devour
burnt meat are barbarians.

811
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,059
Do try the sauce, Kai.

812
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:45,539
Here, I made it myself.

813
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:47,030
Oh, thank you.

814
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,900
But first, I'd like to say a few
words in Jennifer's memory.

815
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,460
A prayer.

816
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:56,920
Always ready for a prayer.

817
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,460
Jennifer,

818
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,851
when I first met you at
the cafeteria four years ago.

819
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:04,380
..

820
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:13,820
You were...

821
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,599
Dear Lord, Jennifer Chilton's

822
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,340
one and only soul

823
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,340
was taken from her
wonderful friend, Kai.

824
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,800
Dear Lord,

825
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:35,239
Jennifer Chilton... Rejoice
in the Lord our one and only

826
00:56:35,985 --> 00:56:41,239
Almighty Let us
sing for our Father's

827
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,519
grace

828
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:49,920
Thank God for our Father's
grace God almighty free at last

829
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,079
We're going to the
promised land A sea of light

830
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:01,860
in your light Your kingdom
in front of our eyes Hallelujah

831
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:08,141
Hallelujah Your servant
at the top has died Let's go!

832
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,059
Let's get up now

833
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:16,380
Forever and then
Come again Come again

834
00:57:26,954 --> 00:57:37,021
For ever is your kingdom God Almighty
God of glory Christ has welcomed us Who HD

835
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:46,360
is God This peace
You are perfect

836
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,219
No, no, no, not at all.
I mean, artificial meat is crap.

837
00:57:52,329 --> 00:57:55,260
How are we supposed to improve it
unless we fail upward to perfection?

838
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,519
No. Arkady, stand tall in
your failures like me, my friend.

839
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,820
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

840
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:08,139
Commander, so you were testing
out your in-flight TV dinner on him?

841
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,340
In-flight TV dinner?

842
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:13,340
Is that what the young
troops are calling it now?

843
00:58:14,179 --> 00:58:15,179
Excuse me.

844
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,019
Are you in a lot of pain?

845
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:20,880
I'm being punished.

846
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:22,280
What?

847
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,980
It's my punishment.

848
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,760
I should have gone to
Nosh and not come here.

849
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:34,940
Dorothy, bring me Purple Joe.

850
00:58:35,769 --> 00:58:38,420
Sir, you remember the special
painkiller we've been developing?

851
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,239
Yeah, Purple Joe.
It's a quick-fix turn to the agents, right?

852
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,199
Yes, since...

853
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,333
Since Mickey here is
in such awful pain, it's

854
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:47,260
a perfect opportunity
to try a little test.

855
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,380
So give it to him.

856
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,460
Oh, great. All right.

857
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,480
Don't touch him, please.

858
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,179
Mickey, can you see me?

859
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,300
Mickey?

860
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:15,099
Mickey!

861
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:16,570
Get back down there.

862
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:18,579
Mickey?

863
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,280
Mickey?

864
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Oh, God. Oh, God.

865
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:30,739
What did he do?

866
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,340
What did he do?

867
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:32,679
Ah!

868
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,559
Apologies, sir.
The painkiller's not working.

869
00:59:45,735 --> 00:59:48,260
Don't film this, Preston.
Please, turn it off.

870
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:52,099
This is better, right? More humane.

871
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,320
Yes, sir. More humane.

872
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,041
No, no, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

873
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,260
Huh?

874
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,501
You can't tear a hole in my fucking carpet!

875
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:00,679
Well, we'll just shoot him from the side.

876
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,239
But what about the blood?

877
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,940
This is a Persian tavern!

878
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:06,949
Honey, calm down.

879
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,340
Shoot him now.

880
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:09,820
What the hell is going on?

881
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:12,519
This was supposed to be a fucking dinner!

882
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:15,039
He's your guest!

883
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,239
Agent Guy Katz, what the
hell's going on with you?

884
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:19,929
He's a meat matrix.

885
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's a goddamn print job.

886
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:22,980
Inexpendable.

887
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,860
He signed up for this.

888
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:26,679
Yes, sir.

889
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,719
This is for our planet, Agent.

890
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:29,980
I'm sorry, sir.

891
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,199
Come on, guys.

892
01:00:33,739 --> 01:00:36,019
Please don't shoot him.

893
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:39,849
I'm okay now.

894
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:42,630
I don't think so.

895
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,090
He still seems like he's in a lot of pain.

896
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,429
Of course he is.

897
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:54,659
Are you really okay?

898
01:00:56,579 --> 01:00:58,050
Just thank you for dinner.

899
01:00:58,610 --> 01:00:59,610
Huh.

900
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,030
My room's just there.

901
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:05,721
You need to clean up and rest, Mickey.

902
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:08,809
Don't worry about me.

903
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:10,309
I can walk.

904
01:01:11,389 --> 01:01:12,791
I just need to get back to my room.

905
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:14,230
No, I'm just about to...

906
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:16,610
Actually, we're going to mine.

907
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,320
Here.

908
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:34,780
It's dry.

909
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:38,460
I drink this whenever I have a stomachache.

910
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,380
It's from Earth.

911
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:42,159
It's precious.

912
01:01:43,195 --> 01:01:44,195
So I've been saving it.

913
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:50,909
But I made some for you.

914
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:54,900
Thanks.

915
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:56,219
Sit.

916
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:05,539
You know, Mickey...

917
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:08,539
I didn't want to ask you this.

918
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:12,860
But just this once, okay?

919
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,000
And I'm so sorry.

920
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,900
What's it like?

921
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Dying?

922
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,380
You're asking because of Jennifer?

923
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:38,639
Yeah.

924
01:02:42,449 --> 01:02:43,889
We locked eyes...

925
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:46,389
in the last moment.

926
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,070
What did you feel?

927
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,670
As all that ice came crashing down on her?

928
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,099
I can't stop thinking about it.

929
01:03:08,909 --> 01:03:12,360
I don't think it's what I usually feel.

930
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,360
It's...

931
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:15,199
I die so often.

932
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,400
Because you know you're
going to wake up again, right?

933
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,400
Because you die knowing that.

934
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,840
Oh...

935
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,670
Well, I always feel scared.

936
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:42,489
It's terrible.

937
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:44,309
Dying.

938
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,210
I hate it.

939
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:52,900
No matter how many times I go through it.

940
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:55,820
It's scary.

941
01:03:58,219 --> 01:03:59,219
Still.

942
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:01,239
Always.

943
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
Every time.

944
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:07,809
But you're here.

945
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,679
And Jennifer isn't.

946
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,030
Out there.

947
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:20,590
The entire universe.

948
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:25,809
She's nowhere.

949
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,981
You don't look like you're printed out.

950
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:53,619
You're just a person.

951
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,949
Are you and Nasha open?

952
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,110
I have to go.

953
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:09,690
Nasha.

954
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:10,969
Please forgive me.

955
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:14,989
The guy that you're having sex with.

956
01:05:15,969 --> 01:05:16,969
That's not me.

957
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:20,630
That's not me.

958
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:22,929
You motherfucker.

959
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:26,190
How dare you touch her.

960
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,710
Seventeen.

961
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,811
I knew this would happen at some point.

962
01:05:55,809 --> 01:05:56,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

963
01:05:56,829 --> 01:05:57,829
Stand, stand.

964
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:59,030
Stand next to each other.

965
01:05:59,809 --> 01:06:00,809
Wait, take this off.

966
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,550
What?

967
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:04,010
Yeah, I want you to look the same.

968
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,480
Oh, my God.

969
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:25,300
Nasha, how can you laugh right now?

970
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,161
This is a multiples violation.

971
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,360
I'm as good as dead.

972
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:29,719
Oh, come on.

973
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,579
When else am I going to get these shots?

974
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,940
I mean, think about it.

975
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,280
It would be so psyched
if there were two of me.

976
01:06:39,949 --> 01:06:40,949
This is mild Mickey.

977
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:45,019
And this is habanero Mickey.

978
01:06:47,949 --> 01:06:49,900
This is so exciting.

979
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:54,159
This is so different.

980
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:56,280
Nasha, you're different, too.

981
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,500
You don't seem like yourself.

982
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,519
Oh, Jesus.

983
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:05,880
You just did oxyzophil with him?

984
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:07,940
Just a teeny tiny bit.

985
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:09,500
With a ton of water.

986
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:09,820
What?

987
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,380
Do you want some?

988
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:11,380
Yeah, yeah.

989
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,460
Relax.

990
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:14,389
Just take it easy.

991
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:15,639
Nasha.

992
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,976
This piece of shit just
tried to kill me earlier.

993
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,800
Right here in this room.

994
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,400
Look, I was bleeding.

995
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:24,240
Like you weren't thinking
of trying the same thing.

996
01:07:24,744 --> 01:07:26,300
I saw you sneaking up behind me.

997
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:26,980
Hey, hey, hey.

998
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Shut up.

999
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:29,039
Shut up.

1000
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,480
And sit down.

1001
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:32,780
Oh, hey.

1002
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:33,860
Attention.

1003
01:07:34,869 --> 01:07:37,539
From now on, I'm going to
feed you both as often as I can.

1004
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,141
So be good boys and don't fight.

1005
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:42,391
Now, 18 tells me you guys
have sorted it out already.

1006
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,380
E-Huff.

1007
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,559
Work off.

1008
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,260
Alternating deaths?

1009
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:48,579
Even so not.

1010
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:51,000
It's a great system.

1011
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,760
Negotiation time.

1012
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:55,059
So everyone just chill.

1013
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,880
Okay?

1014
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:30,905
You leave us alone for a sec.

1015
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,479
Why?

1016
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,560
What's the problem?

1017
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:37,949
I'm leaving.

1018
01:08:38,579 --> 01:08:40,000
Oh, you're such a baby.

1019
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:41,920
I'm scared.

1020
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:43,439
This guy needs some oxyzole for him.

1021
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,640
Relax.

1022
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:44,779
Talk about what?

1023
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,251
I don't care about your private life.

1024
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,159
Okay, fine.

1025
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:50,699
But what's up?

1026
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,479
What's the rush? Where are you going?

1027
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:55,260
I just witnessed the multiples
violation with my own eyes.

1028
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:57,581
As an agent, I have a duty to report it.

1029
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,586
Since when have you been
coming to Mickey's room?

1030
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:11,180
This is your first time, right?

1031
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,131
What's up with you and Kai, bro?

1032
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:17,220
Why was she here?

1033
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,661
What are you supposed to do now?

1034
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:22,859
She's gonna go straight to
Marshall and report us, isn't she?

1035
01:10:23,578 --> 01:10:24,578
You need to relax.

1036
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,260
Nosh is handling it.

1037
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,479
She can convince anybody of anything.

1038
01:10:30,448 --> 01:10:31,920
Phew. Oh my God.

1039
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,920
Besides, this moron is
busy with his clown show.

1040
01:10:47,363 --> 01:10:48,363
This fucker.

1041
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:50,658
Such an attention whore.

1042
01:10:56,038 --> 01:10:58,439
And what did that asshole serve for dinner?

1043
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,880
Was it good at least?

1044
01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:02,609
You really wanna know?

1045
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,881
What went down at that dinner?

1046
01:11:06,618 --> 01:11:07,618
So...

1047
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,319
the one with 17 on his chest...

1048
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:13,336
that's the Mickey that
was in my room just before?

1049
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,640
Mm-hmm.

1050
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,439
And the one you were grabbing...

1051
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,380
he's 18, right?

1052
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,720
Yeah.

1053
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,180
Okay.

1054
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,288
You can have 18. I'll take 17.

1055
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:32,810
Whoa.

1056
01:11:33,609 --> 01:11:34,609
There's two of them.

1057
01:11:34,649 --> 01:11:35,649
Why not share?

1058
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:37,510
All right.

1059
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:40,069
So you get this straight.

1060
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:43,810
You were shitting your pants on the floor.

1061
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:50,130
And he comes up and stabs
you in the neck with a syringe.

1062
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:53,899
That's what happened.

1063
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:57,149
I wasn't, like, shitting my pants.

1064
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,029
I was just puking up a little.

1065
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,670
That's not the point!

1066
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:05,239
I've seen you rubbing up on Mickey
every chance you get, you fuckface.

1067
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:08,069
You know, I've always wanted
to kick the living shit out of you.

1068
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:10,470
Oh, Masha, come on.
I'm trying to be considerate.

1069
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:12,890
Mickey, 17...

1070
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:16,649
was about to double dip,
if you know what I mean.

1071
01:12:18,069 --> 01:12:19,470
Move on from you to me.

1072
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:22,569
In fact, we almost...
Double dip?

1073
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:24,050
Shut up!

1074
01:12:24,328 --> 01:12:24,448
Oh.

1075
01:12:24,694 --> 01:12:26,614
Mickey is not some
cookie you can split in half.

1076
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:28,609
17 and 18 are both Mickey.

1077
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:30,170
Both my Mickey.

1078
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,729
So then after Marshall fucks you sideways,

1079
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,359
you really let him have it, right?

1080
01:12:35,868 --> 01:12:36,868
Right!

1081
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,750
What did you say?

1082
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:42,510
I said...

1083
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:44,930
I said I said thank you for dinner.

1084
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:50,868
You said what?

1085
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:54,488
I said thank you for dinner.

1086
01:12:54,715 --> 01:12:55,988
Thank you for fucking what?

1087
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,640
God!

1088
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,078
You son of a bitch!

1089
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,100
Fucking loser!

1090
01:13:08,908 --> 01:13:09,908
Mike...

1091
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:12,109
I guess I am kind of a loser.

1092
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:13,810
What?

1093
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:18,890
Is that what you are?

1094
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,250
Huh?

1095
01:13:20,488 --> 01:13:21,488
Is it?

1096
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:22,710
Free Atlanta!

1097
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:26,430
The floor to the promised land!

1098
01:13:27,149 --> 01:13:28,149
And free Hawaii!

1099
01:13:28,368 --> 01:13:29,368
God!

1100
01:13:29,908 --> 01:13:30,908
Gah!!

1101
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:45,609
It's not your fault.

1102
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,979
Let's kill that fucker.

1103
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,158
This guy would be killing each...

1104
01:13:55,658 --> 01:13:56,658
Kill this, kill that!

1105
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,180
Why don't we kill everybody?

1106
01:13:58,645 --> 01:14:00,364
She can stay here and watch TV if you like.

1107
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,118
You can stay here and watch TV if you like.

1108
01:14:01,121 --> 01:14:01,279
W. wait!

1109
01:14:01,529 --> 01:14:05,840
You can't negotiate
shit with that attitude.

1110
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:12,118
Hey Jesus. You're hot on oxyzole foam.

1111
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:14,899
Mickey!

1112
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:20,140
He has your gun.

1113
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:20,479
Gun?

1114
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:21,658
We have to stop him.

1115
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,238
What? Where's he going?

1116
01:14:26,654 --> 01:14:32,060
Why? Why? Why is Commander Marshall cutting
into that big beautiful handsome rock?

1117
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:50,600
It's sleek, hot, exquisite.

1118
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,100
This is where our names will be etched.
Mine and yours.

1119
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,198
And you! And you! And you!

1120
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,859
And you, my beautiful Eoclid.

1121
01:15:05,538 --> 01:15:10,260
Almost every single one of you will
be remembered throughout history

1122
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:13,279
as the proud founders of Eoclid.

1123
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,560
The land of Niflheim's first generation.

1124
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:21,238
Our cornerstone. Black diamond.

1125
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:24,198
Beautiful and shimmering in purity.

1126
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,618
This rock will become the
symbolic monument of Niflheim.

1127
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,779
The one and only pure colony planet.

1128
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:34,078
The one and only Niflheim!

1129
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:36,158
The one and only Niflheim!

1130
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,380
The one and only!

1131
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:24,649
God, don't touch it, sir!

1132
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:26,609
Maybe it's contagious!

1133
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:27,970
It's contagious!

1134
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,149
You touch it, you die!

1135
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:40,118
Damn it!

1136
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,520
I say it's contagious!

1137
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,698
Stay calm! God damn it!

1138
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,800
Scalding!

1139
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,640
Initiate stay calm!

1140
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,600
... ... ... ... ...

1141
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,760
...

1142
01:17:07,618 --> 01:17:08,618
...

1143
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:14,698
...

1144
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:44,310
... ... ...

1145
01:17:44,908 --> 01:17:45,908
...

1146
01:17:51,069 --> 01:17:52,609
... ... ... ...

1147
01:17:53,109 --> 01:17:56,149
... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

1148
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,300
...

1149
01:18:13,578 --> 01:18:17,078
Don't shoot!
I'm not about to control! Don't shoot!

1150
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:23,319
Yes? Calm down. Calm down.
We have everything under control.

1151
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,238
You have, Marshal!

1152
01:18:28,113 --> 01:18:34,100
Those low-life multiples have
ruined our precious symbology.

1153
01:18:40,698 --> 01:18:42,618
Kill it! Get down, sir!

1154
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,779
Open fire!

1155
01:18:52,788 --> 01:18:53,788
Kill it!

1156
01:19:10,828 --> 01:19:12,890
Arrest him, fucking multiples.

1157
01:19:30,578 --> 01:19:35,059
Tell the committee you are aiming
at the Creeper behind Marshal.

1158
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:38,180
Otherwise you could
get permanently deleted.

1159
01:19:40,569 --> 01:19:41,569
Fuck that shit.

1160
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,381
You really think Captain
Crane Pie is going to let us live?

1161
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:50,051
He's probably going to shoot us himself.

1162
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:53,578
He's a nutjob.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

1163
01:19:55,545 --> 01:19:57,786
He's the biggest, dumbest
nutjob out of all the Mickeys.

1164
01:19:58,265 --> 01:19:59,386
And that's saying something.

1165
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,038
You screwed my entire life up.

1166
01:20:03,649 --> 01:20:06,130
Oh, really? We all got
fucked the minute you

1167
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,859
decided not to die and
came crawling home to me.

1168
01:20:09,828 --> 01:20:12,198
That wasn't my fault.
That was the Creeper's fault.

1169
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:15,260
Creeper?

1170
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,082
Well, if that Creeper
is eating me like it's

1171
01:20:18,095 --> 01:20:20,500
supposed to, then we
won't be in this situation.

1172
01:20:21,948 --> 01:20:25,060
But they all kicked me out,
and I'm a goddamn multiple.

1173
01:20:26,505 --> 01:20:27,158
They kicked you out?

1174
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,420
Yeah.

1175
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:35,180
You're all pushing me and pulling me,
and they all threw me back into the snow.

1176
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:41,658
Maybe I didn't look tasty enough,
or smelled off. I don't know.

1177
01:20:43,904 --> 01:20:45,265
Maybe I was in some kind of sauce.

1178
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,460
Hold on. You're telling me they saved you?

1179
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:57,640
Think about it. You shouldn't have died
in that crevasse. The Creeper saved you.

1180
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:06,020
Uh, I guess if you put it like that,
uh, they were sort of saying me off.

1181
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:09,609
I mean, maybe I should have said thank you.

1182
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,399
Yeah. I don't think they
were going to eat you. Right?

1183
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,939
Oh, my God.

1184
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,081
We have to report this to science.
They saved humans.

1185
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:23,279
Yeah. People need to know this.

1186
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,880
They saved me.

1187
01:21:38,505 --> 01:21:41,305
Where's the fucking ladder?
You're supposed to bring a fucking ladder.

1188
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:42,488
I don't know.

1189
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:46,090
Here. Let me help.

1190
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:49,390
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Stop. I'll do it myself.

1191
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,649
I'm coming down myself. Get the fuck off.

1192
01:21:55,729 --> 01:21:56,729
Come on.

1193
01:21:57,488 --> 01:21:59,368
Hey, Timo. What are you doing here?

1194
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:03,488
Oh, wow. You two really are multiples, huh?

1195
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:05,130
But it's you.

1196
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,470
Yeah, I see it in that
schmuck face of yours.

1197
01:22:08,484 --> 01:22:10,390
You're the one that
gave me this. Right?

1198
01:22:11,448 --> 01:22:12,448
Oopsie.

1199
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:16,109
Here you go, guys.
You guys must be starving.

1200
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,470
Thanks, man. I knew you'd be coming for us.

1201
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,670
What are you up to?

1202
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:25,210
What's all that?

1203
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,448
So, um, here's the thing.

1204
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:34,310
I need to shoot a video
and send it to Earth ASAP.

1205
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,828
Video? To Earth?

1206
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:40,630
Yeah. Um, it's for, uh...

1207
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,340
Darius Blank.

1208
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,510
Darius Blank? Who's that?

1209
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:52,069
I found this at my door today.

1210
01:22:52,988 --> 01:22:54,210
It's written by hand.

1211
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:56,550
It's a beautiful handwriting.

1212
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,001
It's from Darius Blank's associate.

1213
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:04,130
Yeah. His associate.

1214
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:07,368
I'm not kidding. His associate.

1215
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:10,511
You know what I mean? Like, of course.

1216
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:14,109
Of course the loan shark
of all fuckin' loan sharks

1217
01:23:14,109 --> 01:23:16,130
would figure out a way
to send one of his guys

1218
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:19,029
to follow us all the way here to Niflheim.

1219
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,590
To where we are right now.

1220
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:23,024
That's like a million fuckin'
miles from the world out there.

1221
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:24,185
You know what I'm talking about?

1222
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:25,216
Do you know how far that is?

1223
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:28,189
No matter what pittance you
manage to scrape together,

1224
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:31,189
we've found that
sending it to Earth will cost

1225
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:34,710
you an intergalactic
transfer fee more than...

1226
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,069
half the total sum.

1227
01:23:37,069 --> 01:23:38,069
God fucking associate!

1228
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:40,130
I have no idea who that is!

1229
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,210
I don't know who that is!

1230
01:23:43,078 --> 01:23:44,078
Isn't that fucking crazy?

1231
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,368
Send a visual work of art.

1232
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,010
That's fucking crazy.

1233
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,630
A video file that captures
the details of death.

1234
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,550
Read the back.

1235
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:56,448
It says, chop up into a
minimum of 13 pieces.

1236
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:56,988
Chop up?

1237
01:23:57,189 --> 01:23:57,948
Is that it?

1238
01:23:57,988 --> 01:23:58,988
What the fuck is this?

1239
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,770
Hey! What did I say about the close-up?

1240
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:03,551
Close-up is more important, okay?

1241
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:06,819
So take the 32K camera
and put it over here for Mr.

1242
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:07,770
Darius Blank.

1243
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:08,930
You understand?

1244
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:14,670
I'm sorry, Nicky.

1245
01:24:15,908 --> 01:24:16,908
It's all there.

1246
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,430
Right? In the letter.

1247
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:22,569
If I shoot this video and I
send it to him, he'll let me live.

1248
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:26,319
If I don't,

1249
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,828
I'm gonna send that guy in.

1250
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,029
He's gonna kill me first.

1251
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:33,420
What am I supposed to do?

1252
01:24:34,788 --> 01:24:36,988
Come on, dude. If I die, that's it for me.

1253
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,220
But you're expendable.

1254
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,770
They'll just print you right back out.

1255
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,010
Please.

1256
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:44,670
Nicky.

1257
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,050
I'm your friend.

1258
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:48,948
Okay?
Please do this for your friend one time.

1259
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:50,725
You gotta do this for me, man.

1260
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:51,750
I'm your brother.

1261
01:24:54,979 --> 01:24:55,979
I'm sorry.

1262
01:24:58,618 --> 01:24:59,618
I'm sorry.

1263
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:01,720
I'm so sorry.

1264
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:06,050
I'm so sorry.

1265
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:07,238
Oh, shit.

1266
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:10,229
I should've killed this guy
when I had the chance.

1267
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:13,538
You guys just do this for me this one time.

1268
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:14,710
That's all I'm asking.

1269
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:15,680
I'm so sorry.

1270
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,880
Stop crying, you prick!

1271
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:19,439
I'm getting on my fucking nerves.

1272
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,636
Why don't you guys do
rock, paper, scissors, okay?

1273
01:25:23,658 --> 01:25:25,340
And then we'll just shoot the loser, yeah?

1274
01:25:26,198 --> 01:25:26,560
No.

1275
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:27,738
All right.

1276
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,880
Shoot him.

1277
01:25:29,698 --> 01:25:30,060
Him?

1278
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,680
Yeah, him.

1279
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,140
I wasn't expecting that.

1280
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:34,060
I thought you'd choose him.

1281
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:35,996
Yeah, you'd think so,
but the soft one's easier.

1282
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:36,300
Come on.

1283
01:25:36,301 --> 01:25:37,301
Come on.

1284
01:25:51,069 --> 01:25:52,729
You're a dumb fucking bitch, Timo.

1285
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:59,210
If you do this and what space lets you
live, you think that'll be the end of it?

1286
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,301
You don't think I'll tell you
to fuck in pieces myself?

1287
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,408
Oh, my God.

1288
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:05,439
What is the big deal?

1289
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:07,331
All right, just take me instead.

1290
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:09,149
What?

1291
01:26:11,738 --> 01:26:12,908
Just chop me up, not him.

1292
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:15,930
Look at him.

1293
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:18,265
You shot him one time with the tager,

1294
01:26:18,288 --> 01:26:21,170
it's like you just boofed a
fucking electric eel, man.

1295
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:25,368
But you can chop my whole
body up into ten mickey chunks,

1296
01:26:26,328 --> 01:26:31,390
and I'll still be fresh as the
freshest sashimi, head held high.

1297
01:26:32,189 --> 01:26:33,189
Theorists will love that.

1298
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:36,711
I just need a little of your help.

1299
01:26:37,029 --> 01:26:38,029
My help?

1300
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:42,328
Can't I need more of that?

1301
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:44,908
Oxy's hopeful.

1302
01:26:47,738 --> 01:26:48,828
Yeah, I got some oxy.

1303
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:49,899
But undiluted.

1304
01:26:51,908 --> 01:26:52,908
You want...

1305
01:26:53,819 --> 01:26:55,828
You want undiluted oxy right now?

1306
01:26:56,069 --> 01:26:57,069
Yeah.

1307
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:00,750
Just think of it as the, uh...

1308
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:06,970
Think of it as the final
cigarette before execution.

1309
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:11,621
It's the least you could do for a friend.

1310
01:27:13,908 --> 01:27:14,908
Give him yours.

1311
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:15,609
What?

1312
01:27:15,788 --> 01:27:16,310
Come on.

1313
01:27:16,729 --> 01:27:17,210
No.

1314
01:27:17,618 --> 01:27:18,706
I'll give you a freebie next time.

1315
01:27:18,729 --> 01:27:19,729
You know me.

1316
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:22,750
This was expensive.

1317
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:30,658
The keys!

1318
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,840
Nasha!

1319
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:44,420
It's all mine.

1320
01:27:45,658 --> 01:27:46,658
Do it!

1321
01:27:51,738 --> 01:27:52,220
Nasha!

1322
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:53,460
What are you doing?

1323
01:27:55,505 --> 01:27:56,505
What's going on here?

1324
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:57,960
Nasha!

1325
01:27:58,180 --> 01:27:59,180
Stay put.

1326
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:04,060
That did kind of shock me a bit.

1327
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:08,380
I mean, she literally was gonna
cut his head off with a chainsaw.

1328
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:14,500
Uh, but then I thought
about it and I was so touched.

1329
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:20,760
She's the only person who'd
ever lose it like that over me.

1330
01:28:22,578 --> 01:28:24,439
And it wasn't the first time either.

1331
01:29:18,828 --> 01:29:19,828
Nasha.

1332
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:22,630
She's the only one who's
always been there for me.

1333
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:25,170
She's always loved me.

1334
01:29:26,689 --> 01:29:27,689
Every me.

1335
01:29:28,908 --> 01:29:29,908
Even him.

1336
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:32,850
The me I don't understand at all.

1337
01:29:33,908 --> 01:29:34,908
What is this?

1338
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:36,229
Oh, you don't know about this.

1339
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:38,029
They've been circling the whole night.

1340
01:29:38,488 --> 01:29:39,488
And still more coming in.

1341
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:40,630
What are they doing?

1342
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:41,710
We don't know.

1343
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:43,770
They can break through solid ice and stone.

1344
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:45,630
Imagine if they all come from this ship.

1345
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:46,288
Terrifying!

1346
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:48,729
But you couldn't even tear
through the sack at the cafeteria.

1347
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:51,270
You hear that?

1348
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,341
It's coming from the one
we captured yesterday.

1349
01:29:53,368 --> 01:29:54,229
Keep going, keep going.

1350
01:29:54,368 --> 01:29:55,368
Wait, you mean the baby?

1351
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:56,368
Well, yeah.

1352
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,210
It's been screaming and crying like one.

1353
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,319
And that's when they all started gathering.

1354
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,640
That was... That was the
one that I... Keep going.

1355
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,100
Never mind.

1356
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:12,698
Hi.

1357
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:14,319
How you doing?

1358
01:30:14,698 --> 01:30:15,698
Excuse me!

1359
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:17,279
Come up.

1360
01:30:17,859 --> 01:30:18,859
Somebody passing through?

1361
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,038
Hey.

1362
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:22,399
Why did they set up
the situation room there?

1363
01:30:22,578 --> 01:30:22,920
Beats me.

1364
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,416
I was just told to bring the prisoner.

1365
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:25,880
Apparently, Otha made a big scene.

1366
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,220
She wants the creeper now.

1367
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,859
Darby, I have crucial
information about the creepers.

1368
01:30:30,408 --> 01:30:32,636
McGee needs to file an official
report with the head of science.

1369
01:30:32,658 --> 01:30:33,658
Oh, wait.

1370
01:30:43,819 --> 01:30:45,198
Yes, I knew it.

1371
01:30:46,038 --> 01:30:49,899
Yesterday, at the cafeteria when
you held on to the baby, I saw it.

1372
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,100
You saw that?

1373
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,576
I don't know what it means, though.

1374
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:53,979
Oh.

1375
01:30:53,979 --> 01:30:54,100
What?

1376
01:30:54,425 --> 01:30:55,506
So you were just imitating?

1377
01:30:55,545 --> 01:30:57,319
Well, originally... No offense.

1378
01:30:57,578 --> 01:30:58,000
What's the matter?

1379
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,658
It's really hectic right now.

1380
01:30:59,779 --> 01:31:00,779
Let's talk later.

1381
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,939
We're recording the sounds to see
if we can analyze any kind of pattern.

1382
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,618
The committee is declaring
a level three emergency.

1383
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:10,287
Sole command and
control has been granted

1384
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,640
to Commander Marshall
by a vote of 36 to 21.

1385
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,060
Thank you.

1386
01:31:18,618 --> 01:31:19,618
What an event.

1387
01:31:19,859 --> 01:31:21,698
This is a truly novel ingredient.

1388
01:31:22,698 --> 01:31:26,020
This opens up a whole new
world of potential sauces.

1389
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:29,100
It's such a great... how should I put it?

1390
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:31,050
Opportunity, ma'am.

1391
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,479
Yes, quite the opportunity.

1392
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,500
Just super.

1393
01:31:33,618 --> 01:31:35,658
Yes, it is a super opportunity.

1394
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:43,630
Oh, wow.

1395
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:46,850
It's such a godsend, too.

1396
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:50,689
It is free from harmful pathogens, correct?

1397
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:51,609
Yes, ma'am.

1398
01:31:51,609 --> 01:31:52,609
Sure.

1399
01:32:12,979 --> 01:32:14,420
Which dickhead is it, Mickey 18?

1400
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,130
Keep his head still!

1401
01:32:22,363 --> 01:32:23,979
Now I can tell you to a punch.

1402
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:25,420
Filthy multiples.

1403
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,100
Oh, yeah.

1404
01:32:26,328 --> 01:32:27,479
That does seem fair.

1405
01:32:27,939 --> 01:32:28,658
Oh, goodness.

1406
01:32:28,899 --> 01:32:29,899
Bright meat.

1407
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,180
That's nothing, honey.

1408
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:34,158
Wait till these two are
scorched sausages in the cyclo.

1409
01:32:34,279 --> 01:32:36,140
How are you going to handle that stench?

1410
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:39,260
Mickey.

1411
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:41,020
I'm so sorry.

1412
01:32:41,899 --> 01:32:42,899
You too.

1413
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:44,738
This brick stores your memories, right?

1414
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,859
Now you'll watch as I permanently
delete your being from it.

1415
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:52,118
That way you'll understand
the meaning and terror of finality.

1416
01:32:52,618 --> 01:32:53,800
No more reprints!

1417
01:32:54,314 --> 01:32:56,435
That's what you both should
be thinking when you die.

1418
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:57,618
Dead forever!

1419
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:01,819
Now that the memory is
gone, which body goes first?

1420
01:33:02,024 --> 01:33:03,479
One of the times, twice the fun.

1421
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,078
Creepy.

1422
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:06,340
Commander Marshall, sir.

1423
01:33:07,899 --> 01:33:08,899
May I say a few words?

1424
01:33:09,515 --> 01:33:11,738
Regardless of who burns
first, the simple fact is...

1425
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:14,149
we currently have two
Mickeys here before us.

1426
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,529
Due to no fault on their part, I might add.

1427
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:19,439
One of them is being falsely
accused of firing his gun at you.

1428
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:21,010
But the truth is...

1429
01:33:22,069 --> 01:33:23,390
he was concerned for your safety.

1430
01:33:24,814 --> 01:33:27,536
He was the first to notice the second
Creeper coming out of the stone behind you.

1431
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,501
And as you are well aware, the day
an expendable is printed... Enough!

1432
01:33:32,488 --> 01:33:35,279
You, defending these idiots,
should be mopping up your own shit.

1433
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:37,100
Illegal possession of oxyzophil.

1434
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:39,609
Concealment of a multiples violation.

1435
01:33:39,819 --> 01:33:40,319
It's disappointing.

1436
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,770
An attempted murder
without... fucking chainsaw?

1437
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,555
I mean, it's quite the colorful rap
sheet, don't you think, Miss Barrage?

1438
01:33:46,578 --> 01:33:48,479
The clouds of war are billowing.

1439
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:50,158
Look at those vermin swarmed.

1440
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,220
Mankind must unite
at this critical juncture.

1441
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,920
Why are we wasting our time
with these dregs of society?

1442
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:58,658
Spoken like a true wartime commander, sir.

1443
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:00,399
Very impressive.

1444
01:34:00,988 --> 01:34:04,640
And a fine entry to add to your
collection of battle quotes, if I may.

1445
01:34:04,819 --> 01:34:05,300
You like that?

1446
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:05,680
I do.

1447
01:34:05,859 --> 01:34:06,500
More of that?

1448
01:34:06,698 --> 01:34:07,100
Please.

1449
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:09,279
You keep mentioning
that we're in a state of war.

1450
01:34:10,948 --> 01:34:12,989
May I be so bold as to
offer two observations, sir?

1451
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,520
Be my guest.

1452
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:19,060
Firstly, fighting a war requires a
huge amount of energy and calories.

1453
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,087
Seeing as we're in
the early stages of

1454
01:34:22,099 --> 01:34:23,961
settlement and our
survival is in the balance,

1455
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:26,279
I wonder whether this
expenditure is prudent.

1456
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,920
Secondly, our apparent
enemies are the Creepers.

1457
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:32,984
But do we know whether they
actually want to engage in war?

1458
01:34:34,118 --> 01:34:36,881
For hours they've been swirling
in circles doing nothing but wailing.

1459
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,899
My God, Agent Verge.

1460
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:44,720
You used to be a five-time
Marshall Cup champion.

1461
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:46,578
Agent of the Month.

1462
01:34:47,555 --> 01:34:51,819
And now you're sweating
over these alien insects?

1463
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,340
How far you've fallen.

1464
01:34:55,868 --> 01:34:59,149
What are you going to do when they tear
a hole in this ship and tear off your ass?

1465
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,100
These grotesque shit gibbons.

1466
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:05,738
Grotesque or not, they are the
native inhabitants of this planet.

1467
01:35:06,823 --> 01:35:08,618
And we have proof that
they saved one of us.

1468
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:11,100
They didn't eat him or attack him.

1469
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,600
Saved and not eaten who?

1470
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:14,960
Uh, me.

1471
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:18,319
They saved me.

1472
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,100
Of course they didn't eat you.

1473
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,310
You're crap food.

1474
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:28,819
You're recycled spam, baby.

1475
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:33,279
You get chewed up and shit
out over and over and over again.

1476
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:35,279
Well, I guess they aren't
just stupid bugs, honey.

1477
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:36,640
I mean, they knew to pass on crap.

1478
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:37,460
Junk.

1479
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,658
They must have some cognitive ability.

1480
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:40,880
Exactly.

1481
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:44,279
Actually, they exhibit
signs of high intelligence.

1482
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:46,819
They may be able to engage
in meaningful conversation.

1483
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:49,198
And we're analyzing this and...

1484
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,680
Sir?

1485
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:54,689
You must try communicating
with them yourself.

1486
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,979
We're developing a sort of translator.

1487
01:36:00,694 --> 01:36:01,840
Like that, you mean?

1488
01:36:02,988 --> 01:36:03,988
You think I'm an idiot?

1489
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,640
Oh, fuck.

1490
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:26,087
Four and a half years
across the fucking galaxy

1491
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:29,658
just to hear these
goddamn alien squawks?

1492
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,779
Tell me how the fuck that
makes any sense, somebody?

1493
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,038
How does this make any sense?

1494
01:36:36,395 --> 01:36:37,916
How does your bullshit make any sense?

1495
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:41,496
You know, your fucking fuckface is what
really doesn't make any fucking sense.

1496
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,520
You fucking...

1497
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:43,625
IDIOT!

1498
01:36:44,609 --> 01:36:45,609
You call them aliens?

1499
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:47,538
We're the aliens, dumbass!

1500
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:48,854
They would have been here before us.

1501
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:49,880
And Mickey...

1502
01:36:51,029 --> 01:36:52,760
Mickey was always just Mickey Barnes.

1503
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:55,489
Do you even understand what that means?

1504
01:36:55,850 --> 01:37:00,060
They were just living their lives
before you came in with your bullshit!

1505
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,238
And you think you get to
decide who lives and who dies?

1506
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:04,859
You are a dumb fuck!

1507
01:37:07,845 --> 01:37:10,460
No wonder you blew the
elections, you fucking moron.

1508
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,920
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1509
01:37:31,149 --> 01:37:32,149
God, hang up!

1510
01:37:42,359 --> 01:37:43,359
Bite.

1511
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:45,380
What?

1512
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:48,538
Falling in three, two, one.

1513
01:37:55,899 --> 01:37:57,750
Fine, as you shut the fuck up.

1514
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,270
This is clearly abuse,
one kiss after the other.

1515
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:07,210
Rolling.

1516
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:11,310
In the 32K.

1517
01:38:13,538 --> 01:38:14,701
Make sure you get everything.

1518
01:38:15,229 --> 01:38:15,930
Impressive teeth.

1519
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:17,149
Yeah.

1520
01:38:17,408 --> 01:38:18,408
We need more of our guys.

1521
01:38:20,149 --> 01:38:23,988
Sir, now might be the prime
time to initiate total extermination.

1522
01:38:24,488 --> 01:38:26,529
The ones out there alone
would be more than enough.

1523
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:27,828
What are you talking about?

1524
01:38:28,453 --> 01:38:30,336
We're gonna gas them,
we're gonna gas them all.

1525
01:38:32,788 --> 01:38:33,788
What's that look for?

1526
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:36,210
Still not confident in your failures?

1527
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:37,510
No, no, sir.

1528
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:41,170
Arcadi 3.0 has gone through
several meticulous stages of testing.

1529
01:38:41,288 --> 01:38:43,788
Arcadi 3.0 is the ultimate nerve gas.

1530
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,788
I have every confidence in it, sir.

1531
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:47,130
As you should, Arcadi.

1532
01:38:47,149 --> 01:38:48,149
This has to succeed.

1533
01:38:49,078 --> 01:38:50,121
I'll put it in my prayers.

1534
01:38:51,069 --> 01:38:52,828
This is the day we've
been waiting for, sir.

1535
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:56,270
Future historians will
mark today as error-defining

1536
01:38:56,283 --> 01:38:58,630
for cleansing dangerous
species on colony planets.

1537
01:38:59,444 --> 01:39:01,326
Why don't you board
the flitter yourself later?

1538
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:03,246
You mean when we spray the gas?

1539
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,270
Yeah.

1540
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:05,710
I pull the trigger?

1541
01:39:05,711 --> 01:39:06,788
Exactly, sir.

1542
01:39:07,479 --> 01:39:11,010
If you write the leaf flitter and
appear to commandeer the operation,

1543
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:13,970
the footage I get, it will be historic.

1544
01:39:14,899 --> 01:39:18,770
And the members, the church
members back on Earth, they will adore it.

1545
01:39:19,368 --> 01:39:20,390
Yes, yes, the company.

1546
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:21,788
All right.

1547
01:39:22,078 --> 01:39:24,788
It's time we initiate
Operation Total Extermination.

1548
01:39:25,029 --> 01:39:26,326
Honey, can I have a word with you?

1549
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:27,350
Yes, my love.

1550
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:29,310
I've got an idea.

1551
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:35,689
I hope you both can appreciate what a
great honor my wife has bestowed on me.

1552
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:37,470
I'm going to be storing
on your shit stains.

1553
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:40,250
And so I can press both
buttons simultaneously?

1554
01:39:41,069 --> 01:39:41,649
Yes, sir.

1555
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,564
Press them and they'll
go off at the same time.

1556
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:46,788
They'll also explode automatically if
they exit the range of the remote control.

1557
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:47,550
You hear that?

1558
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:48,630
I have you by the balls.

1559
01:39:48,685 --> 01:39:49,965
Don't even think of running off.

1560
01:39:50,149 --> 01:39:52,246
You'll each be given a primitive
weapon as you head out.

1561
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:54,712
You cut off as many creeper
tails as you can, and the

1562
01:39:54,725 --> 01:39:57,090
first Mickey to bring back
100 tails is the winner.

1563
01:39:57,795 --> 01:39:58,876
And the winner doesn't die.

1564
01:39:58,908 --> 01:40:00,729
But the loser goes...

1565
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:02,649
Boom!

1566
01:40:02,788 --> 01:40:03,090
Boom!

1567
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:03,689
Boom.

1568
01:40:03,689 --> 01:40:04,689
Boom.

1569
01:40:04,935 --> 01:40:06,328
A world keeps going from here.

1570
01:40:06,689 --> 01:40:09,273
Your job is to make
them scream so loudly that

1571
01:40:09,283 --> 01:40:12,050
every last creeper comes
running in to save them.

1572
01:40:12,698 --> 01:40:14,710
We'll kill two birds with
one stone, right honey?

1573
01:40:14,868 --> 01:40:18,250
Oh, absolutely. 100 tails is enough to
make enough sauce to last a couple years.

1574
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:19,788
Better be on your toes.

1575
01:40:20,913 --> 01:40:22,609
One false move and you're man burger.

1576
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:40,109
It's all punishment.

1577
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:43,069
What was that?

1578
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:48,890
My entire life's a goddamn punishment.

1579
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:51,590
All for pressing that
button when I was five.

1580
01:40:53,109 --> 01:40:54,750
Oh, this again.

1581
01:40:57,310 --> 01:40:59,649
Accident was caused by a
car defect, you know that?

1582
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:01,850
I don't know.

1583
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:09,029
Well, it wasn't pressing
that stupid button.

1584
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:12,710
It wasn't while I was driving either.

1585
01:41:14,288 --> 01:41:15,689
How many times I gotta tell you?

1586
01:41:20,189 --> 01:41:21,189
Sorry, Mickey.

1587
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:23,788
Mickey, you need to move. Like, now.

1588
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:26,010
Can you at least put the ramp down?

1589
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,729
We can't do that right now. I'm sorry.

1590
01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:28,988
You're gonna have to drive.

1591
01:41:28,989 --> 01:41:29,989
What?

1592
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:33,050
Mickey!

1593
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:40,420
Take this.

1594
01:41:42,069 --> 01:41:44,296
It's not finished, but it might help
you communicate with the Creepers.

1595
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:44,560
Let's go.

1596
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:46,760
Is this like a translator thing?

1597
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:48,020
Yes. Good luck.

1598
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,220
For what it's worth, I doubt
Marshall will kill both of you.

1599
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:52,279
Come on.

1600
01:41:52,578 --> 01:41:53,578
Come on.

1601
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:56,581
Well, I... Go.

1602
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:06,868
With this device, I got a job to do.

1603
01:42:08,828 --> 01:42:09,828
All right.

1604
01:42:09,948 --> 01:42:12,649
They saved me. Now I save them.

1605
01:42:13,368 --> 01:42:15,069
What are those fuckers doing?

1606
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:16,810
Even I can count.

1607
01:42:17,038 --> 01:42:18,841
Dozens of fresh tails
they're leaving behind.

1608
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:20,090
Are they out of their minds?

1609
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:21,930
Oh, honey.

1610
01:42:23,038 --> 01:42:24,729
Should I just press the button?

1611
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:25,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1612
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,970
Let's sit back and watch.

1613
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:32,162
They'll start chopping
tails as soon as they

1614
01:42:32,176 --> 01:42:34,310
realize one of them
has to outlive the other.

1615
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:36,488
Hey!

1616
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:37,850
Hey!

1617
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,250
It's me!

1618
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:42,800
You gotta run away!

1619
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:45,118
You gotta get them all out of here!

1620
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,300
You gotta go back to your cave!

1621
01:42:48,078 --> 01:42:50,880
Go back to your cave!

1622
01:42:54,663 --> 01:42:56,100
Or you're all gonna die.

1623
01:42:58,738 --> 01:42:59,738
What?

1624
01:43:00,078 --> 01:43:01,078
Oh, hello.

1625
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:03,960
Um...

1626
01:43:04,779 --> 01:43:06,520
Yes, I just... I wanted...

1627
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,220
About last time, I...

1628
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,100
Uh...

1629
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:10,760
I...

1630
01:43:11,085 --> 01:43:12,340
I wanted to say...

1631
01:43:12,939 --> 01:43:13,939
Thank you.

1632
01:43:14,618 --> 01:43:15,618
Um...

1633
01:43:16,738 --> 01:43:18,078
Do you remember me right?

1634
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,560
Mickey.

1635
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,760
Uh...

1636
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:26,198
How do you know my name?

1637
01:43:30,038 --> 01:43:31,038
Cigarette.

1638
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:33,961
Wait, are they having a conversation?

1639
01:43:35,738 --> 01:43:36,738
Yes.

1640
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:38,800
We already explained it just now.

1641
01:43:38,801 --> 01:43:39,140
How?

1642
01:43:39,319 --> 01:43:40,319
How is this possible?

1643
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,340
Oh, well, it's still a prototype,
but it's like a translator device.

1644
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:47,158
Dor... Dorothy?

1645
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:48,880
Oh, no, where's Dorothy?

1646
01:43:49,795 --> 01:43:51,435
I can't hear a thing with all the static.

1647
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:53,720
I mean, even the video is shit!

1648
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:59,381
Apologies, sir. The snowstorm is exacerbating
the absorption... What about this?

1649
01:43:59,805 --> 01:44:00,805
Will this detonator work?

1650
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:03,920
Yes, sir. That is a special
shortwave signal, so it'll be fine.

1651
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,118
And who's that big one there?

1652
01:44:06,069 --> 01:44:07,461
Is that the queen bee of the bunch?

1653
01:44:07,484 --> 01:44:09,859
Hmm, looks like a croissant dipped in shit.

1654
01:44:11,064 --> 01:44:14,086
Uh, official reports
are still being finalized,

1655
01:44:14,096 --> 01:44:17,260
but we think everything
revolves around that one.

1656
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,738
The mama creeper.

1657
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:21,180
So that one's the boss. Like you.

1658
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,220
Say what?

1659
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:29,720
We gotta get out of here, or they're
gonna kill you all with this death gas.

1660
01:44:30,859 --> 01:44:35,560
That gas, Arcadi 3.0,
I got blasted with that.

1661
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:36,600
It's seriously...

1662
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,500
...insanely painful.

1663
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,899
Do you know what gas is? Gas?

1664
01:44:43,738 --> 01:44:44,738
Like...

1665
01:44:46,038 --> 01:44:47,038
...like gas?

1666
01:44:50,779 --> 01:44:53,399
Mind your own business, stupid.

1667
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,238
Mind my own business? What about you?

1668
01:44:57,979 --> 01:44:59,640
Why'd you save him at the cave?

1669
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:04,500
Should kill him?

1670
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:05,920
No!

1671
01:45:06,359 --> 01:45:07,359
No!

1672
01:45:07,819 --> 01:45:11,500
I'm... ...we're very
grateful. That's all.

1673
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,300
Then why?

1674
01:45:15,819 --> 01:45:17,738
Why kill Luko?

1675
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,060
Uh... ...Luko?

1676
01:45:24,658 --> 01:45:25,738
Baby...Luko.

1677
01:45:27,158 --> 01:45:28,158
Oh.

1678
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,538
You grew.

1679
01:45:33,038 --> 01:45:34,118
Shattered.

1680
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:36,500
Blood.

1681
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,840
Yeah, uh...

1682
01:45:38,538 --> 01:45:39,538
...oh, that's, uh...

1683
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,618
...that's Luko.

1684
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:44,859
We save you.

1685
01:45:48,078 --> 01:45:50,760
You kill Luko.

1686
01:45:55,658 --> 01:45:57,520
So what's the name of the other baby?

1687
01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:59,250
The one on the ship?

1688
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:01,760
Zuko.

1689
01:46:03,979 --> 01:46:05,760
Kill Zuko, too.

1690
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:10,618
What if Zuko dies? What will you do?

1691
01:46:13,578 --> 01:46:14,578
Death.

1692
01:46:15,618 --> 01:46:16,618
All.

1693
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:21,770
You mean all humans.

1694
01:46:26,939 --> 01:46:27,939
Extinction!

1695
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,300
How?

1696
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:32,359
Easy.

1697
01:47:18,529 --> 01:47:21,430
Unless somebody
wants to kill me.

1698
01:47:24,069 --> 01:47:25,069
Desperate.

1699
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,430
Dusko.

1700
01:47:56,091 --> 01:48:00,010
уль What's wrong with them? What's wrong
with him? And they're saying something.

1701
01:48:00,868 --> 01:48:03,630
What is that idiot saying?
It's not sign language.

1702
01:48:16,529 --> 01:48:18,510
C3? C3? What's C3?

1703
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:31,310
Bring the baby! Bring the baby!

1704
01:48:33,649 --> 01:48:37,844
Honey, this doesn't sit
well with me. Why are those

1705
01:48:37,854 --> 01:48:41,649
two losers chatting with
the boss of the bugs?

1706
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:44,609
They think they're negotiating
on behalf of mankind, humankind?

1707
01:48:45,215 --> 01:48:46,734
You should be standing out there, sir.

1708
01:48:47,404 --> 01:48:49,368
Ushering in this historic moment.

1709
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:55,670
You're seeing two bosses meeting
face to face in a climactic snowstorm?

1710
01:48:55,788 --> 01:48:56,788
A moment of destiny?

1711
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:58,791
All you have to do is go out there.

1712
01:48:59,194 --> 01:49:00,750
I know I can create an iconic scene.

1713
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:04,130
A decisive moment in the
history of the Niflheim settlement.

1714
01:49:04,578 --> 01:49:06,609
Oh, I can picture it now.

1715
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:09,788
Adorning the ceiling and
the walls of the Grand Chapel.

1716
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:11,170
Yes, ma'am. Yes.

1717
01:49:12,703 --> 01:49:13,908
One final touch, sir.

1718
01:49:15,029 --> 01:49:18,328
I think it would be great if you give
them a message before spraying the gas.

1719
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:19,630
A message?

1720
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:23,018
Without such poignancy,
today will be a third-rate

1721
01:49:23,029 --> 01:49:26,090
carnival where we spray cheap
pesticide over cockroaches.

1722
01:49:26,819 --> 01:49:31,729
Yes, they are disgusting, filthy, evil
insects, but it will be their last moment.

1723
01:49:32,279 --> 01:49:35,908
And you could offer them a few
merciful words as a proper farewell.

1724
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:38,788
Like a wise, benevolent priest.

1725
01:49:39,988 --> 01:49:42,970
Get me a camera crew. Tell the
first squad to meet me fully armed.

1726
01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:43,529
Yes, sir.

1727
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,729
My love, the Situation Room is yours.

1728
01:49:45,988 --> 01:49:46,988
Till we meet again?

1729
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,578
C-3!

1730
01:49:53,038 --> 01:49:54,038
Not who you want to meet.

1731
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:55,220
It's the wrong thing.

1732
01:49:56,420 --> 01:49:58,100
I want to get Sokol back safe.

1733
01:49:58,359 --> 01:49:59,359
I mean it!

1734
01:50:01,899 --> 01:50:02,899
Not enough.

1735
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,600
But what else?

1736
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:08,920
We lose Luko.

1737
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,720
One.

1738
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:13,939
Be fair.

1739
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:16,300
Be fair?

1740
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:18,340
And we have to contribute to death?

1741
01:50:20,109 --> 01:50:21,109
Yes.

1742
01:50:21,939 --> 01:50:22,939
Fair.

1743
01:50:24,038 --> 01:50:25,300
One of yours.

1744
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:27,340
Die.

1745
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:30,960
So if we bring back Sokol
safe, and a human dies?

1746
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:34,050
Peace.

1747
01:50:36,618 --> 01:50:37,618
Peace.

1748
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:07,658
Peace.

1749
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:08,680
Do you copy?

1750
01:51:09,078 --> 01:51:11,850
Okay, the radio signal is
a little patched right now,

1751
01:51:11,853 --> 01:51:14,520
so the comms speaker will
be on the right line of comms.

1752
01:51:14,618 --> 01:51:16,180
Units, who do you copy?

1753
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:20,300
Our orders are to send you a
score for under-martial... Die!

1754
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:22,340
I'm not going to dance!

1755
01:51:22,779 --> 01:51:25,020
Do not entertain the queen!

1756
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:26,140
Die!

1757
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:27,479
I'm down.

1758
01:51:36,118 --> 01:51:39,555
Okay, right after your speech,
sir, we'll close the canopy

1759
01:51:39,556 --> 01:51:42,060
at once, and that will be
the signal for the air squad.

1760
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:43,319
Spray that gas.

1761
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,880
Glorious annihilation, sir.

1762
01:51:48,779 --> 01:51:49,100
You.

1763
01:51:49,319 --> 01:51:49,779
Yes, you.

1764
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:50,118
Come here.

1765
01:51:50,198 --> 01:51:50,560
What's your name?

1766
01:51:50,618 --> 01:51:50,859
Matthew?

1767
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:51,538
Oh, Matthew.

1768
01:51:51,710 --> 01:51:52,819
You have the face of an angel.

1769
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:53,020
Here.

1770
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:54,300
Try my socks.

1771
01:51:54,939 --> 01:51:55,939
Here you go.

1772
01:51:56,238 --> 01:51:57,238
Tell me what you think.

1773
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:58,680
No!

1774
01:51:59,158 --> 01:52:00,158
No!

1775
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:00,600
No!

1776
01:52:00,899 --> 01:52:01,899
No!

1777
01:52:02,279 --> 01:52:02,600
No!

1778
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:02,738
No!

1779
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:04,279
No!

1780
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:09,479
No!

1781
01:52:09,479 --> 01:52:10,479
No!

1782
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:10,658
No!

1783
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:11,661
Take it easy.

1784
01:52:13,238 --> 01:52:15,020
One snap and it's instant death.

1785
01:52:18,189 --> 01:52:19,880
Nasha Barrage, what do you want?

1786
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,640
The baby.

1787
01:52:23,479 --> 01:52:24,800
We have to take it to the moment.

1788
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:25,640
That's all?

1789
01:52:25,859 --> 01:52:26,859
Yes.

1790
01:52:27,479 --> 01:52:28,479
Guarantee us a safe exit.

1791
01:52:29,689 --> 01:52:31,331
Unless you want to see me break her neck.

1792
01:52:32,939 --> 01:52:33,340
No.

1793
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,720
Nasha, please don't.

1794
01:52:35,569 --> 01:52:37,698
Look, we secure Nasha's exit as negotiated.

1795
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:40,038
Nasha, can you release her carefully?

1796
01:52:42,939 --> 01:52:43,939
Let me get the baby.

1797
01:52:43,979 --> 01:52:44,979
Be careful.

1798
01:52:45,578 --> 01:52:46,560
Nasha, are you okay?

1799
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:47,038
I need to hurry.

1800
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:48,560
Can I get a flitter?

1801
01:52:48,738 --> 01:52:49,158
I doubt it.

1802
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,180
You'll have to run.

1803
01:52:58,118 --> 01:53:02,198
Ma'am, today you and the
commander have displayed

1804
01:53:02,212 --> 01:53:05,720
an impressive range
of verbal and physical

1805
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:09,220
abuse and acts of cruelty that
far exceed your granted authority.

1806
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:11,238
You want to be executed for mutiny?

1807
01:53:11,845 --> 01:53:15,078
All video evidence of abuse will be
presented to the committee for review.

1808
01:53:15,810 --> 01:53:17,930
I suggest you have answers
prepared for your hearing.

1809
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:19,300
Thanks, Zeke.

1810
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:22,479
Maintain control on site.

1811
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:26,300
Here!

1812
01:53:35,609 --> 01:53:43,609
We'll start slowly circling
the creature from the outside...

1813
01:53:43,609 --> 01:53:46,510
Making the scene
absolutely spectacular, sir.

1814
01:53:48,189 --> 01:53:50,788
I'll keep my speech short and tight.

1815
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:54,770
A marvelous address, no need to add it.

1816
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:57,270
And then I'll blow off the mickeys.

1817
01:53:57,689 --> 01:53:58,649
Pokemon Go!

1818
01:53:58,649 --> 01:54:02,069
You can do this, Nachi.
We'll get things under control inside.

1819
01:54:02,408 --> 01:54:04,810
Okay. See ya.

1820
01:54:04,948 --> 01:54:05,948
Good luck!

1821
01:54:12,899 --> 01:54:14,260
Nachi's gonna figure this all out.

1822
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:15,680
His own will be back, you see.

1823
01:54:17,118 --> 01:54:18,118
Who is that?

1824
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:20,140
Who's coming?

1825
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:57,880
Wait.

1826
01:54:58,340 --> 01:54:59,538
What is this bullshit?

1827
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:03,538
Which one's your mama?

1828
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:09,020
What the fuck am I supposed to be
looking at when I make my speech?

1829
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:13,479
I was gonna send them off with some dinghy!

1830
01:55:14,618 --> 01:55:16,779
Now a barbarian can fuck off!

1831
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:19,520
Is that bazooka ready?

1832
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:21,180
Yes, sir. Loading now.

1833
01:55:21,779 --> 01:55:24,560
We're gonna blast that
mama bitch into oblivion.

1834
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:26,500
We need to fucking speed.

1835
01:55:28,118 --> 01:55:29,220
I'll go hard.

1836
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,359
That's the mama there, sir!

1837
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,118
Can you see it?

1838
01:55:32,359 --> 01:55:33,460
That's a different shit!

1839
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:35,220
Yes, it's her!

1840
01:55:38,078 --> 01:55:39,618
It's not her death!

1841
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:41,319
Sorry, sir.

1842
01:55:47,618 --> 01:55:48,618
McKay!

1843
01:55:50,118 --> 01:55:51,118
Naza!

1844
01:55:51,819 --> 01:55:52,819
Naza!

1845
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:21,960
Come to say goodbye.

1846
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,600
What?

1847
01:56:23,859 --> 01:56:24,920
Jesus Christ!

1848
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,460
I knew you would make it!

1849
01:57:24,779 --> 01:57:25,960
Is the baby okay?

1850
01:57:26,859 --> 01:57:27,859
Look!

1851
01:58:20,863 --> 01:58:21,863
You're also afraid.

1852
01:58:29,738 --> 01:58:30,738
Yeah, I'm afraid.

1853
01:58:31,238 --> 01:58:32,729
I need you, human.

1854
01:58:34,649 --> 01:58:35,689
You're important.

1855
01:58:38,085 --> 01:58:39,130
Come to me, my boy.

1856
01:59:24,649 --> 01:59:32,649
Okay, guys!

1857
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,310
Guys!

1858
01:59:34,908 --> 01:59:35,908
Don't be shy.

1859
01:59:35,988 --> 01:59:37,670
Sit down, take your seats.

1860
01:59:38,404 --> 01:59:40,609
The groundbreaking
ceremony will come later.

1861
01:59:40,770 --> 01:59:42,448
But we'll start with the expendable stuff.

1862
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:45,328
Mickey, come up to the front, mate.

1863
01:59:46,319 --> 01:59:48,930
Can someone please sit on the
front row, you fucking introverts.

1864
01:59:56,118 --> 01:59:57,118
Hello everyone.

1865
01:59:58,170 --> 01:59:59,890
I'm Nasha Barrage, member of the committee.

1866
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:06,479
After weeks of debate, we have
finally come to this momentous day.

1867
02:00:07,939 --> 02:00:09,960
The day we abolish the
Expendables Programme.

1868
02:00:10,930 --> 02:00:13,649
I would like to thank my fellow
committee members for their support.

1869
02:00:14,189 --> 02:00:15,819
I've been really feeling the love.

1870
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:18,800
And especially for
fighting right to the end

1871
02:00:19,859 --> 02:00:23,319
and persuading the committee to
permanently abolish human printing.

1872
02:00:24,738 --> 02:00:28,198
I would like to thank our
very own Mickey Barnes.

1873
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:33,238
And to be fair, I'm just so fucking
happy I get to grow old with Mickey.

1874
02:00:33,479 --> 02:00:35,238
I was really stuck in
getting old by myself.

1875
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,100
Okay.

1876
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:39,840
Alright.

1877
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:43,270
So you hit the button.

1878
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:44,420
Wait.

1879
02:00:45,328 --> 02:00:46,411
Nasha will give the signal.

1880
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:47,640
You hit the button.

1881
02:00:47,819 --> 02:00:48,220
Wait.

1882
02:00:48,488 --> 02:00:49,488
And then over there...

1883
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:52,180
Do I get up and press it or...?

1884
02:00:52,555 --> 02:00:53,555
No, in my seat, right?

1885
02:00:53,904 --> 02:00:55,640
I honestly couldn't give a fuck.

1886
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:00,578
Henceforth, on Niflheim, as on Earth,

1887
02:01:01,038 --> 02:01:03,698
human printing is now
permanently abolished.

1888
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:10,760
Here today, the human
printer will be burnt to ashes

1889
02:01:11,944 --> 02:01:13,000
and erased from memory.

1890
02:01:14,328 --> 02:01:15,439
Nasha's such a natural.

1891
02:01:16,328 --> 02:01:18,770
I think she could even run for
committee chair next election.

1892
02:01:19,505 --> 02:01:21,760
It blows my mind still to
think that this amazing woman

1893
02:01:21,761 --> 02:01:25,840
just six months ago was riding
with the rest of us in that shitty prison.

1894
02:01:28,890 --> 02:01:30,500
The day Marshall got blown to dust,

1895
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:33,560
Ilfa went into shock and
was taken to the psych ward.

1896
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:36,738
Rumors went around that
she slit her wrists there.

1897
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:39,698
And everyone else
involved was shoved into jail

1898
02:01:39,701 --> 02:01:42,479
and somehow lucky Timo
squeezes out on parole.

1899
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,680
But as soon as he got out, he
spent every day dreading the moment

1900
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:50,121
he'd come face to face with
the man who delivered the letter.

1901
02:01:51,319 --> 02:01:53,819
The associate of Darius Blank.

1902
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:55,819
Who one day finally jumped him.

1903
02:01:58,899 --> 02:02:00,380
It was a fight to the death.

1904
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:05,380
In the end, the associate became a...

1905
02:02:06,279 --> 02:02:07,279
cyclosoup.

1906
02:02:09,630 --> 02:02:10,630
Except for one ear.

1907
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:16,020
Even at the trial, Timo
chooses to represent himself.

1908
02:02:18,363 --> 02:02:21,920
As he had his grip on me, he brought his
knife around to my midsection right here.

1909
02:02:22,658 --> 02:02:24,158
And he sliced...
And he got released.

1910
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:25,779
...took him...
...on self-defense.

1911
02:02:26,734 --> 02:02:27,734
Classic Timo.

1912
02:02:28,663 --> 02:02:31,618
But our trials, on the other
hand, were never-ending.

1913
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:37,000
It became a whole political
fight between all the pro-marshals

1914
02:02:37,609 --> 02:02:39,260
and the anti-marshals.

1915
02:02:39,899 --> 02:02:42,220
But by then, Nasha had made up her mind.

1916
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:45,538
She'd overhauled the
committee and changed it herself.

1917
02:02:46,279 --> 02:02:49,340
So after she got out, she
really did run in the election.

1918
02:02:50,925 --> 02:02:52,500
And she won in a landslide.

1919
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:58,600
On her first day in the assembly,
Nasha was so cool about the whole thing.

1920
02:03:01,210 --> 02:03:03,300
I was very, very nervous.

1921
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:06,100
I don't think she really noticed, though.

1922
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:09,060
Nikki?

1923
02:03:09,899 --> 02:03:11,100
I got the upgraded translator.

1924
02:03:11,198 --> 02:03:12,198
It just came out.

1925
02:03:16,024 --> 02:03:17,024
Okay, let's be fair.

1926
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:18,340
Can I ask you a question?

1927
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:21,319
Go.

1928
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:26,060
You said before about
extinction and all that.

1929
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:28,238
When you're all like...

1930
02:03:30,130 --> 02:03:31,880
...and, like, screeching and everything.

1931
02:03:34,180 --> 02:03:35,180
Mmm...

1932
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:39,038
...would that really
make our brains explode?

1933
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:41,359
From, like, the pitch?

1934
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:45,460
Explode.

1935
02:03:46,555 --> 02:03:51,439
But you said that our
eyeballs would explode.

1936
02:03:52,939 --> 02:03:53,939
Mmm...

1937
02:03:54,109 --> 02:03:55,560
...why not our eardrums?

1938
02:03:56,590 --> 02:03:58,158
Because it's, like, sound.

1939
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,698
All I explode.

1940
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:04,840
Really?

1941
02:04:06,274 --> 02:04:07,399
Can you try it right here?

1942
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:08,460
Right now?

1943
02:04:25,078 --> 02:04:27,729
Who said bluffing was only for humans?

1944
02:04:29,069 --> 02:04:31,010
Gotta love that, uh, poker face.

1945
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:34,350
Yeah, and, uh, nice burp, too.

1946
02:05:40,529 --> 02:05:41,529
Uh, hello?

1947
02:05:42,908 --> 02:05:43,908
What are you doing here?

1948
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:45,850
In the middle of the night?

1949
02:05:46,658 --> 02:05:49,399
Well, I just, uh...

1950
02:05:49,738 --> 02:05:51,439
...I thought you were in the hospital.

1951
02:05:51,618 --> 02:05:52,359
Hey, watch it.

1952
02:05:52,359 --> 02:05:53,359
Look down.

1953
02:05:53,569 --> 02:05:54,979
Don't step on it.

1954
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,201
It's a priceless delicacy, Bab.

1955
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:02,060
Go on.

1956
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:03,180
Take a dab.

1957
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:04,420
Have a taste.

1958
02:06:07,939 --> 02:06:08,538
A what?

1959
02:06:08,930 --> 02:06:10,689
Now you're too good
for sauce off the floor?

1960
02:06:11,375 --> 02:06:14,496
You think anyone else would allow scum
like you to taste something so refined?

1961
02:06:15,198 --> 02:06:16,198
What is...

1962
02:06:17,630 --> 02:06:18,630
...what is it made of?

1963
02:06:18,658 --> 02:06:19,658
Rude.

1964
02:06:19,835 --> 02:06:20,835
Not how it works.

1965
02:06:21,569 --> 02:06:23,439
A taste of faith comes first.

1966
02:06:23,899 --> 02:06:25,060
Then I tell you what's in it.

1967
02:06:25,569 --> 02:06:27,756
Mickey, you don't think
I'm letting you taste this

1968
02:06:27,769 --> 02:06:29,880
out of some high regard
for your palate, do you?

1969
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:31,340
It's the opposite.

1970
02:06:32,055 --> 02:06:34,702
A true masterpiece would
be a sauce that could

1971
02:06:34,712 --> 02:06:37,198
appeal to even an
ignorant cretin like you.

1972
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:46,479
Whatever.

1973
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:48,560
Fuck it. Taste it. Waste it. I don't care.

1974
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:49,710
You're worthless now.

1975
02:06:50,408 --> 02:06:52,680
Much better to bring back my usual taster.

1976
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:56,140
The supreme one with
an actually refined palate.

1977
02:06:59,939 --> 02:07:01,140
Wait. That's...

1978
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:05,380
Even his kidneys are
more handsome than you.

1979
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:11,658
Not this. It can't be.

1980
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:16,899
Of course it can.

1981
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:19,600
Admit it. It's what you want.

1982
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:22,000
It's what everyone wants.

1983
02:07:25,399 --> 02:07:26,420
Hey, Ilfa.

1984
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,720
I just remembered.

1985
02:07:33,618 --> 02:07:34,819
You died...

1986
02:07:35,479 --> 02:07:37,078
...the day after Marshall.

1987
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:59,100
Go ahead. Touch me.

1988
02:08:00,698 --> 02:08:03,439
See if I'm ghost or human.

1989
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:11,828
Ever since I was a kid,
I've had scary dreams.

1990
02:08:13,198 --> 02:08:14,390
This time I wasn't scared.

1991
02:08:16,270 --> 02:08:19,170
I just thought to myself, what would 18 do?

1992
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:22,310
Fuck off.

1993
02:08:23,908 --> 02:08:25,550
What are you doing? Press the button.

1994
02:08:25,770 --> 02:08:27,649
Mickey, press it.

1995
02:08:39,390 --> 02:08:41,310
I am glad the printer's gone.

1996
02:08:41,569 --> 02:08:44,291
But a part of me can't
help feeling guilty that I

1997
02:08:44,301 --> 02:08:47,368
didn't let all the other
Mickeys have a chance at life.

1998
02:08:47,984 --> 02:08:49,890
But I have to stop feeling guilty.

1999
02:08:51,609 --> 02:08:53,350
It's okay for me to be happy.
