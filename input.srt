2
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,620
How did I survive that?

3
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,400
It was some damn fall.

4
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,840
Oh shit. My comms busted.

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,360
My thermals busted too.

6
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,380
I should have got snapped in
half and died on the way down.

7
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,680
Instead of slowly turning
into a meat popsicle.

8
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Seymour!

9
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,700
Seymour! I'm down here!

10
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Seymour!

11
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Mickey?

12
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Seymour!

13
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Seymour, I'm down here!

14
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:48,300
Mickey! Whoa!

15
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,460
You haven't died yet?

16
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:51,980
No!

17
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Hold on.

18
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,850
Oh shit!

19
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,581
Your flamethrower's still good.

20
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,830
Not a single scratch.

21
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,166
It's a good thing I thought
to come down here.

22
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,551
Weapons will be happy to see this.

23
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,666
Yeah, I'm gonna turn this in, okay?

24
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,690
I can take it.

25
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,210
You're not mad, right?

26
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,830
That I'm just taking this?

27
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,150
I mean, it's not looking
very good for you, right?

28
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,651
Also, line only goes this far.

29
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,170
Uh-huh.

30
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
Yeah, I know.

31
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,350
We're cool.

32
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,231
You shouldn't have to take the risk, huh?

33
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,711
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

34
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,291
Plus, they're gonna reprint
you back out tomorrow anyway.

35
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Yeah.

36
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,730
Hey, Mickey.

37
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,630
Yeah?

38
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,011
What's it feel like to die?

39
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,961
I'm sure you're used to it by now.

40
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,920
Still.

41
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:08,921
Still.

42
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,830
How many times is this?

43
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,860
You're Mickey 16?

44
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,820
17.

45
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Jerk.

46
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,320
18 after this one.

47
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,200
Well, it's nice knowing you.

48
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,380
Have a nice death.

49
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
See you tomorrow.

50
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,410
Oh, great.

51
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,550
Why not?

52
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,920
That's a pretty big one.

53
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,060
Hopefully, I'll just get
swallowed in one go.

54
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,740
It's gotta be better than
slowly freezing to death.

55
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I guess.

56
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,820
Or maybe not.

57
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,680
But they just printed me
out again every time I died.

58
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,700
All my data is saved and I
just get a whole new body.

59
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,573
They do all this kind of regular
uploads of memories and

60
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:48,620
my personality traits and
re-implant it back in my brain.

61
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,140
That's some crazy technology, man.

62
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's just say it's advanced.

63
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,750
It's very advanced.

64
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,580
Come on.

65
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Wait.

66
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,380
Just hold on a second.

67
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,560
Just like, you know, calm down.

68
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,040
Just relax.

69
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,420
Breathe.

70
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,840
That's right.

71
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
Breathe.

72
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,155
The whole body printing and memory transplanting thing,
to be honest, was so ridiculously ahead of its time

73
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:30,240
that it caused so many, like, ethical fights and religious
blah blah blah that it was actually banned on Earth.

74
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:35,160
And they only allow it now in
outer space for expandables like me.

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,261
So from the second we
left the atmosphere, they

76
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,740
made me work my ass
off all the way to this planet.

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,420
Gave me one mission after another.

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Uh, Tech?

79
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
What's going on?

80
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
The extra cable's here already.

81
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,260
Um, the thing is, Mickey...

82
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,920
Hey, Medical, you wanna tell him?

83
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
Tell me what?

84
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,820
Hi, Mickey. How you doing? Um...

85
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,660
Are you experiencing any
vertigo, nausea, or dizziness?

86
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,000
Uh, I guess I am feeling a little dizzy.

87
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,220
It's only gonna get worse from
here, Mickey, with a nice fever, too.

88
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,838
Truth is, you're exposed to
unthinkable levels of radiation

89
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,960
right now, which is why we
sent you out in the first place.

90
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Okay.

91
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,996
If you could give us a full
description of your symptoms.

92
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,560
So, a couple things I wanna go
through on our cosmic radiation checklist.

93
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:29,800
First, how long until
your skin starts to bleed?

94
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,920
Then, how long until you go blind?

95
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,560
And of course, how long until you die?

96
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,620
That's the real nut we're after.

97
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,200
There was this one time in my fourth grade
science class, I messed with a lab frog.

98
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,160
I just figured this all
must be my punishment.

99
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,680
Mickey, take off your glove so I can see
what's happening under your space suit.

100
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,510
Oh! Oh!

101
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,790
Wow! Did you see that?

102
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,660
Good morning.

103
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,090
Good morning.

104
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,900
Keep yourself hydrated, Mickey.

105
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,960
You'll start to feel extremely parched.

106
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,360
Arkady, I think the dose was too high.

107
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,080
Who cares, Dorothy?
He's gonna be dead in ten minutes.

108
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,120
Just focus on getting
all the blood samples.

109
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,860
He's gonna bleed through his
eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and rectum.

110
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Make sure to collect separate
samples from everyone.

111
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,880
Okay? And keep the memory
upload going at the same time.

112
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,040
This Mickey's special.
You know that, right?

113
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,240
Out of all the Mickeys, you
will have the shortest life span.

114
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
I heard.

115
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,140
Terminus.

116
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,020
Well, aren't you any good news?

117
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,700
Smaller than 15. Much better, isn't it?

118
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,936
I would have been filthy rich
by now with life insurance,

119
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:29,060
except I have obviously
expendables or uninsurance.

120
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:33,900
There's no workers' comp,
no unions, no pension benefits.

121
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,368
Now, I wouldn't be surprised
if you were thinking at

122
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:40,480
this point, well, then why
did you do this to yourself?

123
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,238
Well, because I had a
friend who told me that

124
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,100
one day macarons would
sell better than burgers.

125
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,224
And because I trusted
this shitty friend and I

126
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:59,880
got an enormous loan from a wonderful
gentleman to open a macaron store.

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,040
All right, all right, calm down.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm well aware that
you have four weeks left.

129
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,200
Just think of this
as a little field trip.

130
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,960
Taste of what may unfold should you
fail to reimburse us in a timely manner.

131
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,800
Besides, you two have a
lot of time on your hands.

132
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,920
With your little macaron shop gone under.

133
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,440
Woo! This is, uh, this is quite a show.

134
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,450
You got on here for me. Quite a show.
The message is clear. I hear you.

135
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,590
I hear it loud and clear. I'm late.
I'm late. The money is late. It's coming.

136
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,420
Darius Blank.
A name I wish I'd never heard.

137
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,800
Mr. Blank is no less concerned with money.
He has plenty.

138
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,630
This building is just
one of his many assets.

139
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,041
Watching his delinquent
borrowers die, savoring

140
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:19,920
the details of death,
that he truly enjoys.

141
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,036
The message is clear. You can stop now.
We can stop. You know, it's, it's, it's...

142
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,920
I hear you. Two, you
know, two weeks, uh,

143
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:27,940
two weeks is all it
takes. All it takes now.

144
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:31,600
And, and, and, and, more time.
More time. More money. More money.

145
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,160
Who caught that gentleman four
days ago at Ulaanbaatar? Mongolian?

146
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Looks expensive.

147
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,937
Best assured, anyone
who misses the deadline,

148
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:53,280
we chase them to
the ends of the Earth.

149
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,120
So we decided to get off of Earth.

150
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,660
Nothing was working out,
and I got no family lying on me.

151
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,863
So I applied to the colony
expedition, but there's,

152
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,100
like, a million other
people with the same idea.

153
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Seems like the whole of this rotten
planet was running away from something.

154
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,680
I guess everybody's got money problems.

155
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,600
But anyway, we had to get on this ship,
because it was the last one of the season.

156
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,880
Waves upon waves of people
desperate to leave Earth.

157
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:27,060
It's clear anti-migrationists are
talking to a brick wall when they insist...

158
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,520
...on fixing up the Earth instead of risking
lives by migrating to another planet.

159
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,340
It feels like these passionate
applicants are already off in space.

160
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,654
More importantly, this
is the expedition led

161
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,140
by former Congressman
Kenneth Marshall...

162
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,500
...who lost his last two elections.

163
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,100
Is this failed politician now trying to
establish a kingdom beyond the stars?

164
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,960
Is it his fanatical supporters who
won him a generous sponsorship...

165
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:59,120
...from a particular religious
organization and corporation?

166
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,140
So many questions left unanswered.

167
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,660
Let's go and talk to the crowd.

168
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,300
Excuse me, are you a
Kenneth Marshall supporter?

169
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:08,620
I am. I am. Big time.

170
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,260
I am a full-on supporter.
I basically am the one and only.

171
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,620
Are you from Marshall's official channel?

172
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,160
No way!
So Marshall's watching this right now?

173
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,380
Oh, my God!

174
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,860
You need to pick me.
I swear. Please, pick me.

175
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,500
You need people young and healthy...

176
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,440
...and gentlemen, we have
another wild sandstorm today.

177
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,800
Access is now restricted to game three.

178
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,980
Please visit our stand for
discounted goggles and masks.

179
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,360
Additional 5% off with
Marshall Pay, as always.

180
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,860
The other expeditions wouldn't
take me, but they're wrong.

181
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,840
I promise I can fix toilets.
I make gingerbreads.

182
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:45,281
You've got to take me, Commissioner.

183
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,650
Expendable.

184
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,090
You're applying to be an expendable?

185
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,870
Seriously?

186
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,620
You read through the whole application?

187
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,790
Uh, yeah.

188
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,430
I should have read through it.

189
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,350
I mean, I didn't have too much of a choice.

190
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,610
I don't have any bona fide certifications.

191
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,770
I don't really have any skills whatsoever.

192
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,425
But then I find out
Timo's already called dibs

193
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,830
on a position for
himself as a flitter pilot.

194
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,370
He only just got his learner's
permit a couple of weeks before.

195
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,530
No idea what he had to
come up with to pull that off.

196
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:36,815
But you've got to give it to him.

197
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,810
Excuse me.

198
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,790
Is there, like, some construction going on?

199
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,170
Sorry, what?

200
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:47,310
I don't hear like a...

201
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,770
like a chainsaw.

202
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,430
Uh, no.

203
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,500
I want it to get the hell out of there.

204
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,670
Somewhere where the
sound couldn't follow me.

205
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,910
Far out into space.

206
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,890
You read through the paperwork?

207
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,390
Yes.

208
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:11,190
You read it, so you know, right,
this is gonna be a pretty extreme job.

209
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:14,170
But it's also gonna be... fun.

210
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,530
I'll explain all the details.

211
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,550
I got so distracted by that smell.

212
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,930
Uh, the smell of this woman's hair.

213
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:26,370
It was like it brought back some
faraway memory or something.

214
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,610
That giant tank downstairs
is called a cycler.

215
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,550
It takes organic waste
produced in the spaceship.

216
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,850
Apple peels, chicken bones, rotten eggs,
dead bodies, human waste, you name it.

217
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,130
Then it combines,
refines and recycles them.

218
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,950
And sends a portion to this printer.

219
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,730
Raw materials for a human body.

220
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,084
Once you die and the
committee approves, it'll

221
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:55,510
print a new version of
your body within 20 hours.

222
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,660
Take your clothes off.

223
00:15:58,945 --> 00:15:59,945
Change into this.

224
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,690
I couldn't even hear
anything she was saying.

225
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,030
It was like all my senses
were focused on my nose.

226
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,890
Like real deja vu, but for a smell.

227
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,310
We're going to do a
full scan of your bio data.

228
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,590
That means you'll be reprinted
exactly as you are right now.

229
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,310
Forever.

230
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,510
I better pop this.

231
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,850
Otherwise it'll be there every time.

232
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,680
Well, I'm glad she didn't
know about the one on my butt.

233
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,260
So after she does the body
scan, she uploaded my memories.

234
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,980
Call it a personality backup.

235
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,728
And I gotta do this
once a week so I don't

236
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,180
have any big gaps every
time they print me out.

237
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,520
In the past, you would have
needed a hard drive the size

238
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:57,180
of a commercial refrigerator
to copy an adult brain.

239
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,030
Now this little brick.

240
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Clever, right?

241
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,100
So I was injected with
some special solution.

242
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,920
It brought back a flood of old memories.

243
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,200
Too many memories.

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We were heading home from the supermarket.

245
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,960
And I asked to sit in the front seat.

246
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,000
I said, I'm big enough.

247
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,420
And that's when I saw the red button.

248
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,380
And I just pressed it and she crashed.

249
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,500
Put it to your head and pull the trigger.

250
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,280
This is the final requirement
to become an expendable.

251
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,400
Prove to me you have faith in this system.

252
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,330
From now on you need to get used to dying.

253
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
This is your job.

254
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:43,270
I began the four and a half
year journey as Mickey One.

255
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,140
When you're stuck in a spaceship
for that long, food is everything.

256
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,440
Warning, Mickey One.

257
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:58,880
Seven calories over the
current ration allocation.

258
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
On that first day in the cafeteria,

259
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,100
I think I might have started thinking,

260
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,620
what have I done?

261
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,460
A little.

262
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,800
The whole room was full of
people eating this crappy food.

263
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,000
And there's total silence.

264
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,560
Like you could hear a pin drop.

265
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,300
Until Kenneth Marshall...
and his wife, Ilfa, walk in.

266
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,760
And a whole bunch of
people just started going nuts.

267
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,960
I was thinking, what
the hell am I doing here?

268
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,680
But that's when I saw her.

269
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Nasha.

270
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,480
That was the first time
I saw Nasha Barrage.

271
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,160
On day one of this long journey.

272
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,060
Keep that up for one...

273
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:20,730
That's two percent of the precious
meal you're eating right now.

274
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,543
As you know, our number
one priority is to conserve

275
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:27,470
food resources until
our arrival at Niflheim.

276
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,130
So that we maximize our survival rate.

277
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,330
So listen up.

278
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,430
Sexual intercourse, for example.

279
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:39,970
Each session consumes
a whopping 100 calories.

280
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,070
At least.

281
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:46,590
Depending on the participant's
duration times friction equals...

282
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:48,990
The point is, Kenneth is
talking to the committee

283
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:51,750
about banning all
sexual activity on the ship.

284
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:04,060
Are you sure this is the
right time to bring that up?

285
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,380
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

286
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,800
It's okay, Ilfa.

287
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:12,800
Am I doing okay?

288
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:14,400
Should I go harder?

289
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,840
Yes, yes. Go hard.

290
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
All right.

291
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,500
Fellow pioneers.

292
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,400
Once we've arrived at Niflheim and
we've secured our food production,

293
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:30,380
we will launch the greatest sex
encouragement campaign in history.

294
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,160
You will spread your
seed across the planet.

295
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,840
Even when it's restrictive,
you will always seafood.

296
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:50,820
NOW.

297
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:51,360
Formigating.

298
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,940
calidad to you.

299
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,500
Início.

300
00:22:56,501 --> 00:23:01,900
God bless um...

301
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,060
God bless...

302
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,120
God bless...

303
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,540
Those four years would have
felt like 40 if it weren't for Nasha.

304
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,060
She stayed with me in the best of times...
and kept by my side in the worst of times.

305
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,830
Not everyone gets lucky
enough to find a soulmate like this.

306
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,960
None of this would have happened
if I'd never boarded this spaceship.

307
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,130
So all hail the great
loan shark, Darius Blank.

308
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:58,805
Thanks, Darius.

309
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,446
But it wasn't like I was slack, you know.

310
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,390
I was super busy every
day taking care of Nasha.

311
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,190
She's an all-in-one elite agent.

312
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,417
And it's not easy
supporting someone who's a

313
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:14,250
soldier, a police
officer, and a firefighter.

314
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:16,990
But what she sees in me, I got no idea.

315
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,610
I'm just grateful.

316
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,750
But as soon as I step out the door,
the ship was filled with mostly dickheads.

317
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,390
Hey, Mickey, right?

318
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,990
Can we just ask?

319
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:34,490
What's it like to die?

320
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,090
You know, when you're reprinted?

321
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,710
Now, how does that feel?

322
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,590
Oh, come on, just tell us.
We really want to know.

323
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:47,450
Imagine spending years
elbow to elbow with these bozos.

324
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:49,575
It was enough to push anyone over the edge.

325
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,590
Sometimes even if
Nasha, who is a model

326
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:56,630
citizen, would have to
step in and remind us...

327
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:59,250
...that we were all one big happy family.

328
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,290
There to help one another.

329
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,190
There to have each other's backs.

330
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,890
A tight-knit, harmonious community.

331
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:14,710
...and the committee
has written about this.

332
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,630
Hey, Mickey.

333
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,670
You must be hungry. Have some more.

334
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,990
Uh, thanks, Kai.

335
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,150
Can you change your shampoo?

336
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,590
Shampoo?

337
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,510
There's only one shampoo in
this entire space. Thank you.

338
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,530
It was a very long trip
in a beautiful community.

339
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,110
Hi.

340
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,450
But, uh, Nasha was obviously
my one and only, you know.

341
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,890
For real.

342
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,510
And as for my one and
only job, I was proud of it.

343
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,730
I felt like I was part of the team.

344
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,130
Be careful.

345
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Patty!

346
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,390
Travelers... And
sisters... And sisters...

347
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:22,370
It is long that we have caught
four years together in this ship...

348
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:25,990
...and that we love you
like our very own family.

349
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:34,430
And here we are right below us
awaits our very own planet of purity...

350
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,950
What's fucking wrong with him?
It's fine, aren't it?

351
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,910
Maybe we have some glue or something.

352
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,010
Like a virgin vanilla ice cream.

353
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,730
Touched for the very first time.

354
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,230
It's gonna be really cold.

355
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,770
Whoever's gone down there
first is gonna freeze to death.

356
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,710
And then, make easy
breaths, fill your lungs,

357
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:07,290
and you're sucking in every single
microscopic particle floating around.

358
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,110
All the viruses.

359
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,410
Fill every avioli.

360
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,490
So good?

361
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,555
Oh, so good!

362
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,750
Brilliant.

363
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,990
There really was an
unknown virus in the air.

364
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,130
A lethal one.

365
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,420
So fucking warm.

366
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm fine.

367
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,840
In the end, thanks to the lab
rats Mickey 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16

368
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:48,780
getting stabbed, gasped, dumped,
and burned, we got the vaccine.

369
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,160
My great gift to mankind.

370
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,900
And so, we didn't need oxygen masks,

371
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,570
and we could see our
breath as much as we wanted.

372
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,640
Look at that, Jennifer. Ridiculous.

373
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,376
I can't believe we
still live in that thing.

374
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I know, right?

375
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
Planfall was ages ago.

376
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:09,320
And we're still eating the
same crappy in-flight TV dinner.

377
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,900
Precisely why we ought to
build residential complexes.

378
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,300
You know, grow crops as soon as possible.

379
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,040
Yeah, sure.

380
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,220
You know, spread the seed.

381
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
Infest the land.

382
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,940
Propagate the species.

383
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
It's freezing.

384
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,370
Whoa.

385
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,890
Look at that color.

386
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,490
Yeah.

387
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,550
It's beautiful.

388
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,610
Oh.

389
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,430
Oh.

390
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,850
Oh.

391
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,410
He's such a klutz.

392
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,300
You should learn some Breakfall moves.

393
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:54,650
You okay?

394
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,070
Yeah, I'm fine.

395
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,190
Come on.

396
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,850
What's Breakfall?

397
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,680
What is it?

398
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,570
Come on, Mickey, let's go!

399
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Go, go, go, go!

400
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,880
Mickey, Mickey, it's Marshall.

401
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,960
You fucking useless little asshole.

402
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
You're an expendable.

403
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,520
You're here to be expended.

404
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:13,000
Damn it!

405
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,580
I'm so sorry.

406
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,400
And why is Jennifer Chilton, a
precious, fertile female, dead and not you?

407
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,300
How do you train us?

408
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,300
You know?

409
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,700
Fuck you.

410
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:22,160
Fuck you.

411
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,780
That's what I want to know.

412
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,820
Disgusting.

413
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:25,820
Really?

414
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
You don't like my sauce?

415
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,820
No, no, no, no, darling.

416
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,060
Those things.

417
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,780
Look at them.

418
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
What the fuck's going on?

419
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,280
They're delicious, aren't they?

420
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,636
Oh, for some reason, I like it.

421
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,140
Hey, you.

422
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,000
Stand still.

423
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Don't move.

424
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,540
They lust.

425
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,260
For humans.

426
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:42,500
God.

427
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:43,501
You're a body of flesh.

428
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Creepy.

429
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,860
Oh, honey.

430
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
That's perfect.

431
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,301
We should call them creepers.

432
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:52,325
I'll call them creepers.

433
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,340
I'm calling them creepers.

434
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,830
Preston, are you listening?

435
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,322
Expendable, I've decided
in the committee that

436
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:02,681
going forward, your
rations will be halved.

437
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,708
So, my shift doubled,
14 hours every day, seven

438
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:11,701
days a week, until I brought
home a creeper sample.

439
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,320
How did I survive that?

440
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,920
What's it feel like to die?

441
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,450
Even on my 17th
go-round, I really hate dying.

442
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:39,190
Still. Always.

443
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,140
Bon appétit.

444
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:01,020
Where am I? What's going on?
I'm not coming out of the printer.

445
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,320
I'm still 17.

446
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,500
Why didn't that thing eat me?

447
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,180
I was passed out.

448
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,080
Did I not look tasty enough?

449
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,420
Oh, I've got it.
They're saving me for their kiddos.

450
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,210
What a great mom.

451
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,500
Oh, please just make it quick.

452
00:34:37,235 --> 00:34:39,220
Come on, guys. Big bites. Big bites.

453
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,340
Ow!

454
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,200
Where are you taking me now?

455
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
Ow!

456
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,280
Has my meat gone bad
after all that reprinting?

457
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm still good meat!

458
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,880
I'm perfectly good meat!

459
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,390
I taste fine!

460
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,520
...

461
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
...

462
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
...

463
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,720
... ...

464
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,380
...

465
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,260
...ditching me out here
in the middle of nowhere...

466
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
...it's not cool!

467
00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:01,380
...that rock is, are you blind? You can't
just have the other bat feuds through here!

468
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,860
Science requested it, so
don't give me shit about it!

469
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,160
You try to jam it in and scratch anywhere
on this date, my date, it's on you!

470
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,332
On me? How? Blame the
guys in science. They cut into

471
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:15,500
this site, but I got specific
orders to bring it as is!

472
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,380
I don't fucking care, okay? Through the
meeting over there, I can't reach them.

473
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,701
I'm not taking the fall for
this. Every time you come in

474
00:37:22,713 --> 00:37:25,600
here, my gate, gate 3, you
act like you own the place.

475
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,460
Why would I wanna own this shit already?

476
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:28,860
You should shut the fuck up, okay?

477
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,420
You know what? You need to get laid.

478
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,060
Fuck you!

479
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,360
...you need to get laid. Fuck you!

480
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,500
Fuck you!

481
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:35,760
Oh damn, Nicky!
Didn't expect to see you out there today.

482
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,080
Wait, is that the time?

483
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
It's 3.30?

484
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,560
...it doesn't really make any sense.

485
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,480
...Do you remember what?
Do you remember when I left?!

486
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:53,600
What did you say?

487
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
...razón!

488
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,920
...shut it off!

489
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,540
...the maze!

490
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,860
...the switch!

491
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,045
It's that time again, the
dinner of your dreams,

492
00:38:17,057 --> 00:38:20,080
with Kenneth Marshall,
who will be this month's

493
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:23,123
lucky guest of honour.
A grand surprise awaits.

494
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:26,060
Hang onto your ship,
because the dove of luck

495
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,460
just might come fluttering its wings with
an invitation for you. From Dove with Love,

496
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
over and out.

497
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
What is this?

498
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
Why aren't you dead?

499
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:26,900
Oh God, oh God, oh God. No, no, no, no.
18? They printed you out today?

500
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,966
What the fuck is going
on? According to Timo, you

501
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:33,280
should be sliding out on one of those
creeper's assholes right about now.

502
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:34,896
You have to put it like that?

503
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,840
Oh God, I'm completely fucked.

504
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
What do you mean?

505
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
We're multiples.

506
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,940
I gotta kill you.

507
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Kill me?

508
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,541
I mean, you should probably
kill yourself if one of us has to die.

509
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:11,580
It's been, like, two hours since I
was printed. I've barely had a life.

510
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,100
Well, I was never dead. So you don't count.
Go back to the cyclone!

511
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,920
Multiples. Where do I even begin?

512
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,767
Mankind is not equipped to
deal with the legal and ethical

513
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:30,780
implications of adopting this
human printing technology.

514
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Please tell me.

515
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,580
Can any of you honestly guarantee
that the technology will not be abused?

516
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,060
No one in their R&D department
could come up with a convincing answer.

517
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,796
But the real problem was
that one of the brains behind

518
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:50,780
human printing turned out
to be a certified psychopath.

519
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,200
Helen Manikova.

520
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,890
I think it's him.

521
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,460
Are you sure?

522
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,300
There was this series of particularly
brutal murders targeting homeless people.

523
00:41:03,301 --> 00:41:05,520
And only one eyewitness account.

524
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,720
But it matched Alan
Manikova's appearance to a tee.

525
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,360
The cops thought they had their man,
except Manikova had a surefire alibi.

526
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:15,534
At the time of the
murder, he was getting his

527
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:17,246
makeup done for a
children's science show.

528
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,760
But the cops had his number.

529
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:29,600
When they raided Manikova's house, they
brought two sets of handcuffs and warrants.

530
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,110
They were on to him.

531
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,800
Or rather, they were on to them.

532
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:35,520
Which one's Manikova Prime?

533
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,380
You?

534
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Or you?

535
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,460
Yep, there were two.

536
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,160
One for the murder, and one for the alibi.

537
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,480
Manikova had printed another
Manikova without the company knowing.

538
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,460
So here's a question for you.

539
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,580
Are they accomplices, or did
one act under the other's orders?

540
00:41:55,975 --> 00:42:00,560
Are these separate and independent crimes,
or were they one person from the get-go?

541
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,200
They only get half portions in jail, or...

542
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,700
they get a full meal each.

543
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:09,580
Police, legal experts,
philosophers, everyone was stumped.

544
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,460
But while Manikova One and Two were
both locked up in an interrogation room,

545
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,780
another homeless man was brutally murdered.

546
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,500
Lo and behold, Manikova Three.

547
00:42:30,045 --> 00:42:33,565
I think it was some cheap
tabloid reporter who called

548
00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:36,820
them multiples, or some
professor or something.

549
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:38,660
Whoever came up with it, it stuck.

550
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,680
And pretty soon the word
multiples spread fear and contempt.

551
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,660
So multiples are an abomination.

552
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,681
They destroy the natural order.

553
00:42:49,075 --> 00:42:51,440
Each soul shall only have one body.

554
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Right?

555
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,500
One soul, one body.

556
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,620
The Lord, he only blesses
this one-to-one union.

557
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,300
But former Congressman Marshall
does have a point worth considering.

558
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,120
It would be a shame.

559
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,840
Not to explore the potential
application of this advanced technology.

560
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,900
I was happy to receive an
invitation from this committee.

561
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,840
You were subpoenaed, Mr. Marshall?

562
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Sure, sure.

563
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:24,280
In any case, I want to take this opportunity
to speak as an expedition commander.

564
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,240
Human printing is a sin.

565
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,200
Multiples are Satan's work.

566
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,541
However, I've been
contemplating how can we use

567
00:43:36,553 --> 00:43:40,080
this abomination for our
common economic benefit.

568
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:48,740
I propose a trial run of human printing far
from Earth under the strictest oversight,

569
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,191
limiting such individuals
to one per expedition

570
00:43:53,203 --> 00:43:56,520
per planet under the
designation expendable.

571
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,960
Multiples, in the case of multiples,

572
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,160
we exterminate every offending individual,

573
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,060
in totality, mind and body, all
for the sake of public service.

574
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,977
On this Niflheim
expedition, all multiples will

575
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:19,060
immediately be arrested,
executed and permanently deleted.

576
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,580
Oh, man.

577
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:29,520
What the hell is this guy?

578
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,060
Nasha told me that Mickey
3 was whiny and clingy,

579
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,580
5 was indecisive and apparently 8
was pretty annoying and kind of stupid,

580
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,180
but none of them were complete nut jobs.

581
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,860
Even this lunatic is scared
of being a multiple, though.

582
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,760
That's permanent deletion.

583
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,220
Trying to trash me in the cycler.

584
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,020
If one of us has to go...

585
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,220
it ain't gonna be me.

586
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,650
We can split the workload, too.

587
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,430
And we can take turns dying.

588
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:53,810
You're 18, so you can take even numbers,
and I'll just cover 19, 21 and odd numbers.

589
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,710
Are you afraid to die?

590
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,590
Kinda, yeah.

591
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,230
You've died plenty of times.

592
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,110
What are you so scared of?

593
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:06,510
Until now, I died
and... I was just...

594
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,890
born again.

595
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,130
You know?

596
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,090
It felt like it was me, continuing on.

597
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,930
But now...

598
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,870
once I die...

599
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,250
it'll be over for me.

600
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,350
It'll be you living on.

601
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,270
You get what I mean?

602
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,360
I don't like you.

603
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,180
You're such a little bitch.

604
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
But I'm you.

605
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,840
I'm not you.

606
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,440
I'm not gonna live like you.

607
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,180
I'm gonna kill you!

608
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:14,690
What the fuck, man?

609
00:47:14,691 --> 00:47:15,891
Are you trying to get noticed?

610
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,350
They don't even have cameras.

611
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,530
Take that off, you dumbass.

612
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,930
Amateur.

613
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,230
Your first time.

614
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,330
No, no.

615
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,001
This is the pure stuff, right?

616
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:26,690
Undiluted?

617
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,301
Who do you think you're talking to?

618
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,310
This...

619
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,330
is pure uncut oxy.

620
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,350
It's fucking rare.

621
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,350
You only get two oxyzulfocapsules
and one flamethrower, man.

622
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,911
... ...

623
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,170
...

624
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:56,970
...

625
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,751
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

626
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,270
...

627
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,070
... ... ... Wait. Fact-checking.

628
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,110
Have fun, man.

629
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,870
Let's kill him.

630
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,070
Are you crazy?

631
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,150
He's like my only friend.

632
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:22,930
Forever.

633
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,490
Same warfare as this meat shit.

634
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:25,870
Wait, wait, wait.

635
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,570
Demo!

636
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:30,690
Mickey, what?

637
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,341
Looks like business is blowing up, huh?

638
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:34,971
What are you talking about?

639
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,310
Another junkie coming in.

640
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,370
Hey!

641
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:54,690
Are you mental?

642
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,910
Wait till I get out of
here or I'll kill you!

643
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:57,990
What the fuck is this?

644
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,830
Come down lower!

645
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,070
You fucking idiot!

646
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,310
Mickey, help me.

647
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,510
What is that?

648
00:49:29,765 --> 00:49:31,086
Why is it so red? That looks hot.

649
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,210
What are you doing?

650
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,230
I want you to have a car dying.

651
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,140
You son of a bitch.

652
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,750
What?

653
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,650
Come on!

654
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,750
Stop!

655
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,890
Stop!

656
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,210
Shh, shh, shh.

657
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
Who's that, Mickey?

658
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,310
Hey, what's going on?

659
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,191
Mickey, what are you doing here?

660
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,400
Uh, Demo accidentally fell in.

661
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,460
But, uh... he's alright now.

662
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,020
I wanna keep dealing, motherfucker.

663
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,580
Watch what you say.

664
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,020
What happened?

665
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,640
You okay?

666
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:22,590
What's up with your hand?

667
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,760
Uh...

668
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,340
I was taking out the trash
and I tripped into the hole.

669
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,726
I would have been a
goner if not for Mickey.

670
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,980
I almost became a cyclodust.

671
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,040
Hey.

672
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,620
You alright?

673
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,561
Don't you stay in bed. It's only been
a few hours since you were printed.

674
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,560
Yeah, I should have died.

675
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,600
You heard the rumor?

676
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,880
Huh?

677
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,380
Some guy out there is
dealing undiluted oxytocin.

678
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:46,900
What?

679
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:49,400
That's crazy. That's pretty messed up.

680
00:50:50,015 --> 00:50:51,015
Between us, Timo?

681
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,740
A drop here and there before
bed to take the edge off?

682
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,860
I get it.

683
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,220
But the pure uncut
stuff is crossing the line.

684
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,380
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

685
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,660
That's... bad.

686
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,100
Nasha, take Mickey home. I'll wrap up here.

687
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
Yes.

688
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,860
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

689
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,031
Today I feel like... B6.

690
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:26,110
B6?

691
00:51:26,111 --> 00:51:27,111
Yeah.

692
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:28,490
Flying Nasha.

693
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,910
It's definitely my place for now.

694
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,150
It's alright.

695
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,370
B6.

696
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,010
B6 was ours, Nasha.

697
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,900
Mickey?

698
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:54,770
Hey, brother.

699
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,696
I was just headed to your room to catch
you, but here you are. Looking good, Mickey.

700
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,720
Yes, sir.

701
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,820
Stand there.

702
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,940
Arm around, please.

703
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,420
Great.

704
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,300
Big smile, Mickey.

705
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,080
Sorry. Could you just stand there?

706
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Great. Thank you.

707
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,580
And action.

708
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
Congratulations.

709
00:52:15,195 --> 00:52:16,236
This month's lucky winner,

710
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:20,400
the fortunate soul who will have the
privilege of a private dinner at the camera,

711
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:24,040
will have a private dinner with the
one and only Kenneth Marshall is...

712
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,060
Is that the barrel?

713
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
It's Mickey.

714
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,240
Great. Big smile. Smile.

715
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,260
Yeah. Amazing.

716
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,000
Okay, cut.

717
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,340
Now, Marshall wants you to come ASAP, okay?

718
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,441
He's got a whole feast
prepared just for you.

719
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,560
The Lord is truly blessing
you today, Mickey.

720
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,866
I need to go back to my room.

721
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,611
You get to stuff your fucking face, Mickey.

722
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,120
I bet that freak is probably

723
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,061
drooling all over my
beautiful Nasha already.

724
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,380
It's disgusting.

725
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,920
What's even more
disgusting is that I'm drooling

726
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:58,841
at the thought of the tenderloin
steak I ordered for Marshall's dinner.

727
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,260
This is so wrong!

728
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,860
So glad you seem to be enjoying it.

729
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,780
How's the sauce?

730
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,100
Oh.

731
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,280
Oh, sorry, sorry. Please.

732
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,560
Continue.

733
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,380
Yeah, yeah, Mickey, uh,

734
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,660
listen, going back to everything that

735
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,320
happened with, uh...

736
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Jennifer?

737
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,600
Yes, Jennifer.

738
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,030
Jennifer, uh...

739
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,500
I know, I know.

740
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,881
When we lost our
dear Jennifer Chilton,

741
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,600
I may have gotten a little

742
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,799
angry and said some
terribly unkind things.

743
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,080
I know it's late, and
I want to apologize.

744
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,537
Oh, he's always like this.

745
00:53:44,837 --> 00:53:45,760
Such an adorable

746
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,841
man, and then suddenly he's all cutthroat.

747
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,940
Sorry.

748
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,960
You're still squishy,
fresh out of the printer.

749
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,820
Continue feeding him.

750
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,540
Oh, anyway, we have
another special guest here.

751
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,640
Hi, Kai.

752
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,490
Sorry I'm late.

753
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,070
You look very nice.

754
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:08,840
Thank you.

755
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Come, come.

756
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,980
It's good to see you.

757
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Sit.

758
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,040
You okay, emotionally?

759
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,250
Yeah, I feel fine, sir.

760
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,560
Thank you.

761
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:20,420
I'm glad to hear it, Kai.

762
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,260
I'm so sorry about Jennifer.

763
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,060
I hear you were extremely close,

764
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:26,610
your best friend.

765
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,881
But I knew you'd stay
strong throughout the long.

766
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
Thank you, ma'am.

767
00:54:30,775 --> 00:54:33,881
But we didn't invite you
here simply to comfort you.

768
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,940
We've had our eyes on you, Cass.

769
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:39,468
Me, sir?

770
00:54:39,469 --> 00:54:42,121
May I ask why?

771
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,380
You're one of us.

772
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:48,840
With your impeccable
genetics, you are the perfect

773
00:54:49,115 --> 00:54:51,861
specimen for the
colony I envision.

774
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,260
Thank you, sir.

775
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,140
That's why the church,

776
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,720
I mean, um, company,

777
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,640
has chosen me to lead this expedition.

778
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,740
The Earth's beyond saving

779
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:05,160
with all its muddied people.

780
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,800
But you,

781
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,670
you're something special,

782
00:55:08,855 --> 00:55:10,680
and I'm creating a world

783
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,480
on a pure white planet

784
00:55:12,705 --> 00:55:16,160
full of superior
people like you and us.

785
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,356
Isn't that right, darling?

786
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,080
Yes. It's his vision,

787
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,680
his sensibilities.

788
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:23,015
But let's be honest.

789
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,860
With your medical records in hand,

790
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,540
you ran to join our expedition

791
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,560
instead of one of those pathetic

792
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,080
planets where they plant microchips

793
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,921
in their artificially
inseminated baby embryos.

794
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,840
You really are the perfect candidate for
Niflheim's natural child birthing program,

795
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,960
aren't you, dear?

796
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,480
Mr. Marshall,

797
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,640
am I just a uterus to you?

798
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,180
No! No, no, no, no, no.

799
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,120
Oh, it's nothing like that.

800
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,900
Kai, no.

801
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
This man is not one to objectify women.

802
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,920
All my husband means to say

803
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,120
is he has very high standards.

804
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:03,060
His only dream is of a planet
exclusively for a pure human race.

805
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,140
That consumes real crops

806
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,490
and real meat

807
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,200
and dinners with delicate,

808
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,360
delicious sauces.

809
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,861
Oh, sauce is the true
litmus test of civilization.

810
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,660
People who devour
burnt meat are barbarians.

811
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,060
Do try the sauce, Kai.

812
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,540
Here, I made it myself.

813
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,030
Oh, thank you.

814
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,901
But first, I'd like to say a few
words in Jennifer's memory.

815
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,460
A prayer.

816
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:30,920
Always ready for a prayer.

817
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,460
Jennifer,

818
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,851
when I first met you at
the cafeteria four years ago.

819
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,380
..

820
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,820
You were...

821
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,600
Dear Lord, Jennifer Chilton's

822
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,340
one and only soul

823
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,340
was taken from her
wonderful friend, Kai.

824
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,800
Dear Lord,

825
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:09,240
Jennifer Chilton... Rejoice
in the Lord our one and only

826
00:57:09,985 --> 00:57:15,240
Almighty Let us
sing for our Father's

827
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
grace

828
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,920
Thank God for our Father's
grace God almighty free at last

829
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:29,080
We're going to the
promised land A sea of light

830
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:35,861
in your light Your kingdom
in front of our eyes Hallelujah

831
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:42,141
Hallelujah Your servant
at the top has died Let's go!

832
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,060
Let's get up now

833
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:50,380
Forever and then
Come again Come again

834
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:11,021
For ever is your kingdom God Almighty
God of glory Christ has welcomed us Who HD

835
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,361
is God This peace
You are perfect

836
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,220
No, no, no, not at all.
I mean, artificial meat is crap.

837
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:29,260
How are we supposed to improve it
unless we fail upward to perfection?

838
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,520
No. Arkady, stand tall in
your failures like me, my friend.

839
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:37,820
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

840
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:42,140
Commander, so you were testing
out your in-flight TV dinner on him?

841
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,340
In-flight TV dinner?

842
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,340
Is that what the young
troops are calling it now?

843
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,180
Excuse me.

844
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,020
Are you in a lot of pain?

845
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,880
I'm being punished.

846
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,280
What?

847
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,980
It's my punishment.

848
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,760
I should have gone to
Nosh and not come here.

849
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,940
Dorothy, bring me Purple Joe.

850
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:12,420
Sir, you remember the special
painkiller we've been developing?

851
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,240
Yeah, Purple Joe.
It's a quick-fix turn to the agents, right?

852
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,200
Yes, since...

853
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,333
Since Mickey here is
in such awful pain, it's

854
00:59:19,345 --> 00:59:21,260
a perfect opportunity
to try a little test.

855
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,380
So give it to him.

856
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,460
Oh, great. All right.

857
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,480
Don't touch him, please.

858
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,180
Mickey, can you see me?

859
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,300
Mickey?

860
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,100
Mickey!

861
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:50,570
Get back down there.

862
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,580
Mickey?

863
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,280
Mickey?

864
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,440
Oh, God. Oh, God.

865
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:04,740
What did he do?

866
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,340
What did he do?

867
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,680
Ah!

868
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,560
Apologies, sir.
The painkiller's not working.

869
01:00:19,735 --> 01:00:22,260
Don't film this, Preston.
Please, turn it off.

870
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,100
This is better, right? More humane.

871
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,320
Yes, sir. More humane.

872
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:29,041
No, no, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

873
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,260
Huh?

874
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,501
You can't tear a hole in my fucking carpet!

875
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:34,680
Well, we'll just shoot him from the side.

876
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,240
But what about the blood?

877
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:38,940
This is a Persian tavern!

878
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:40,950
Honey, calm down.

879
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,340
Shoot him now.

880
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:43,820
What the hell is going on?

881
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,520
This was supposed to be a fucking dinner!

882
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,040
He's your guest!

883
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,240
Agent Guy Katz, what the
hell's going on with you?

884
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:53,930
He's a meat matrix.

885
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It's a goddamn print job.

886
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,980
Inexpendable.

887
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,860
He signed up for this.

888
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,680
Yes, sir.

889
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,720
This is for our planet, Agent.

890
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,980
I'm sorry, sir.

891
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,200
Come on, guys.

892
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,020
Please don't shoot him.

893
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:13,850
I'm okay now.

894
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,630
I don't think so.

895
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,090
He still seems like he's in a lot of pain.

896
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:20,430
Of course he is.

897
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,660
Are you really okay?

898
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,050
Just thank you for dinner.

899
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:33,610
Huh.

900
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,030
My room's just there.

901
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,721
You need to clean up and rest, Mickey.

902
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:42,810
Don't worry about me.

903
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,310
I can walk.

904
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:46,791
I just need to get back to my room.

905
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,230
No, I'm just about to...

906
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,610
Actually, we're going to mine.

907
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,320
Here.

908
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,780
It's dry.

909
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,460
I drink this whenever I have a stomachache.

910
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,380
It's from Earth.

911
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,160
It's precious.

912
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:18,195
So I've been saving it.

913
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,910
But I made some for you.

914
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:28,900
Thanks.

915
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,220
Sit.

916
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,540
You know, Mickey...

917
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:42,540
I didn't want to ask you this.

918
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,860
But just this once, okay?

919
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,000
And I'm so sorry.

920
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,900
What's it like?

921
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Dying?

922
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,380
You're asking because of Jennifer?

923
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,640
Yeah.

924
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:17,890
We locked eyes...

925
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,390
in the last moment.

926
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,070
What did you feel?

927
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,670
As all that ice came crashing down on her?

928
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,100
I can't stop thinking about it.

929
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:46,360
I don't think it's what I usually feel.

930
01:03:46,361 --> 01:03:47,361
It's...

931
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,200
I die so often.

932
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,400
Because you know you're
going to wake up again, right?

933
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,400
Because you die knowing that.

934
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,840
Oh...

935
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,670
Well, I always feel scared.

936
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,490
It's terrible.

937
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,310
Dying.

938
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,210
I hate it.

939
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,900
No matter how many times I go through it.

940
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,820
It's scary.

941
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,220
Still.

942
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:35,240
Always.

943
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,400
Every time.

944
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:41,810
But you're here.

945
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:46,680
And Jennifer isn't.

946
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,030
Out there.

947
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,590
The entire universe.

948
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:59,810
She's nowhere.

949
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,981
You don't look like you're printed out.

950
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,620
You're just a person.

951
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,950
Are you and Nasha open?

952
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:40,110
I have to go.

953
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,690
Nasha.

954
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:44,970
Please forgive me.

955
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:48,990
The guy that you're having sex with.

956
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:50,970
That's not me.

957
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:54,630
That's not me.

958
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,930
You motherfucker.

959
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:00,190
How dare you touch her.

960
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:24,710
Seventeen.

961
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,811
I knew this would happen at some point.

962
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:30,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

963
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:31,830
Stand, stand.

964
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,030
Stand next to each other.

965
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:34,810
Wait, take this off.

966
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,550
What?

967
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,011
Yeah, I want you to look the same.

968
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,480
Oh, my God.

969
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,300
Nasha, how can you laugh right now?

970
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,161
This is a multiples violation.

971
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,360
I'm as good as dead.

972
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,720
Oh, come on.

973
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,580
When else am I going to get these shots?

974
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:07,940
I mean, think about it.

975
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,280
It would be so psyched
if there were two of me.

976
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:14,950
This is mild Mickey.

977
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,020
And this is habanero Mickey.

978
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,900
This is so exciting.

979
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,160
This is so different.

980
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:30,280
Nasha, you're different, too.

981
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:31,500
You don't seem like yourself.

982
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
Oh, Jesus.

983
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,880
You just did oxyzophil with him?

984
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:41,940
Just a teeny tiny bit.

985
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,500
With a ton of water.

986
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:43,820
What?

987
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,380
Do you want some?

988
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,380
Yeah, yeah.

989
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,460
Relax.

990
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:48,390
Just take it easy.

991
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,640
Nasha.

992
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,976
This piece of shit just
tried to kill me earlier.

993
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,800
Right here in this room.

994
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,400
Look, I was bleeding.

995
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,241
Like you weren't thinking
of trying the same thing.

996
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:00,300
I saw you sneaking up behind me.

997
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,980
Hey, hey, hey.

998
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Shut up.

999
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,040
Shut up.

1000
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,480
And sit down.

1001
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,780
Oh, hey.

1002
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,860
Attention.

1003
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:11,540
From now on, I'm going to
feed you both as often as I can.

1004
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,141
So be good boys and don't fight.

1005
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:16,391
Now, 18 tells me you guys
have sorted it out already.

1006
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,380
E-Huff.

1007
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:19,560
Work off.

1008
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,260
Alternating deaths?

1009
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,580
Even so not.

1010
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,000
It's a great system.

1011
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,760
Negotiation time.

1012
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:29,060
So everyone just chill.

1013
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,880
Okay?

1014
01:09:03,745 --> 01:09:04,906
You leave us alone for a sec.

1015
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,480
Why?

1016
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,560
What's the problem?

1017
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:11,950
I'm leaving.

1018
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,000
Oh, you're such a baby.

1019
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:15,920
I'm scared.

1020
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:17,440
This guy needs some oxyzole for him.

1021
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,640
Relax.

1022
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,780
Talk about what?

1023
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:21,251
I don't care about your private life.

1024
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,160
Okay, fine.

1025
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,700
But what's up?

1026
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,480
What's the rush? Where are you going?

1027
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:29,260
I just witnessed the multiples
violation with my own eyes.

1028
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,581
As an agent, I have a duty to report it.

1029
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:42,586
Since when have you been
coming to Mickey's room?

1030
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,181
This is your first time, right?

1031
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,131
What's up with you and Kai, bro?

1032
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,220
Why was she here?

1033
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,661
What are you supposed to do now?

1034
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,860
She's gonna go straight to
Marshall and report us, isn't she?

1035
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:13,580
You need to relax.

1036
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,260
Nosh is handling it.

1037
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,480
She can convince anybody of anything.

1038
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:20,920
Phew. Oh my God.

1039
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,920
Besides, this moron is
busy with his clown show.

1040
01:11:36,365 --> 01:11:37,365
This fucker.

1041
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,660
Such an attention whore.

1042
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,440
And what did that asshole serve for dinner?

1043
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,880
Was it good at least?

1044
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:51,610
You really wanna know?

1045
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,881
What went down at that dinner?

1046
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,620
So...

1047
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,320
the one with 17 on his chest...

1048
01:12:00,335 --> 01:12:02,336
that's the Mickey that
was in my room just before?

1049
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,640
Mm-hmm.

1050
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,440
And the one you were grabbing...

1051
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,380
he's 18, right?

1052
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,720
Yeah.

1053
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:13,180
Okay.

1054
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,290
You can have 18. I'll take 17.

1055
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:21,810
Whoa.

1056
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:23,610
There's two of them.

1057
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:24,650
Why not share?

1058
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:26,510
All right.

1059
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,070
So you get this straight.

1060
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:32,810
You were shitting your pants on the floor.

1061
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:39,130
And he comes up and stabs
you in the neck with a syringe.

1062
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,900
That's what happened.

1063
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:46,150
I wasn't, like, shitting my pants.

1064
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,030
I was just puking up a little.

1065
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,670
That's not the point!

1066
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,241
I've seen you rubbing up on Mickey
every chance you get, you fuckface.

1067
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,071
You know, I've always wanted
to kick the living shit out of you.

1068
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,471
Oh, Masha, come on.
I'm trying to be considerate.

1069
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:01,890
Mickey, 17...

1070
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,650
was about to double dip,
if you know what I mean.

1071
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:08,470
Move on from you to me.

1072
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:11,571
In fact, we almost...
Double dip?

1073
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:13,050
Shut up!

1074
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:13,450
Oh.

1075
01:13:13,695 --> 01:13:15,616
Mickey is not some
cookie you can split in half.

1076
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,610
17 and 18 are both Mickey.

1077
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,170
Both my Mickey.

1078
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:21,730
So then after Marshall fucks you sideways,

1079
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,361
you really let him have it, right?

1080
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:25,870
Right!

1081
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,750
What did you say?

1082
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:31,510
I said...

1083
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,930
I said I said thank you for dinner.

1084
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,870
You said what?

1085
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,490
I said thank you for dinner.

1086
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:44,990
Thank you for fucking what?

1087
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,640
God!

1088
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,080
You son of a bitch!

1089
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,100
Fucking loser!

1090
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:58,910
Mike...

1091
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,110
I guess I am kind of a loser.

1092
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:02,810
What?

1093
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,890
Is that what you are?

1094
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,250
Huh?

1095
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:10,490
Is it?

1096
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:11,710
Free Atlanta!

1097
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:15,430
The floor to the promised land!

1098
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,150
And free Hawaii!

1099
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,370
God!

1100
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:19,910
Gah!!

1101
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:34,610
It's not your fault.

1102
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,980
Let's kill that fucker.

1103
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,160
This guy would be killing each...

1104
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,660
Kill this, kill that!

1105
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,181
Why don't we kill everybody?

1106
01:14:47,645 --> 01:14:49,366
She can stay here and watch TV if you like.

1107
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,120
You can stay here and watch TV if you like.

1108
01:14:50,121 --> 01:14:50,280
W. wait!

1109
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:54,840
You can't negotiate
shit with that attitude.

1110
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:01,120
Hey Jesus. You're hot on oxyzole foam.

1111
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,900
Mickey!

1112
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,140
He has your gun.

1113
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:09,480
Gun?

1114
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,660
We have to stop him.

1115
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,240
What? Where's he going?

1116
01:15:15,655 --> 01:15:21,060
Why? Why? Why is Commander Marshall cutting
into that big beautiful handsome rock?

1117
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:39,600
It's sleek, hot, exquisite.

1118
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:44,100
This is where our names will be etched.
Mine and yours.

1119
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:48,200
And you! And you! And you!

1120
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,860
And you, my beautiful Eoclid.

1121
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:59,260
Almost every single one of you will
be remembered throughout history

1122
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,280
as the proud founders of Eoclid.

1123
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,560
The land of Niflheim's first generation.

1124
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,240
Our cornerstone. Black diamond.

1125
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:13,200
Beautiful and shimmering in purity.

1126
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,620
This rock will become the
symbolic monument of Niflheim.

1127
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:20,780
The one and only pure colony planet.

1128
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:23,080
The one and only Niflheim!

1129
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,160
The one and only Niflheim!

1130
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,380
The one and only!

1131
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:13,650
God, don't touch it, sir!

1132
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,610
Maybe it's contagious!

1133
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:16,970
It's contagious!

1134
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,150
You touch it, you die!

1135
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:29,120
Damn it!

1136
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,520
I say it's contagious!

1137
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,700
Stay calm! God damn it!

1138
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
Scalding!

1139
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,640
Initiate stay calm!

1140
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,601
... ... ... ... ...

1141
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,760
...

1142
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:57,620
...

1143
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,700
...

1144
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:33,310
... ... ...

1145
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:34,910
...

1146
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:41,611
... ... ... ...

1147
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:45,151
... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

1148
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,300
...

1149
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:06,080
Don't shoot!
I'm not about to control! Don't shoot!

1150
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:12,320
Yes? Calm down. Calm down.
We have everything under control.

1151
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,240
You have, Marshal!

1152
01:19:17,115 --> 01:19:23,100
Those low-life multiples have
ruined our precious symbology.

1153
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,620
Kill it! Get down, sir!

1154
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,780
Open fire!

1155
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:42,790
Kill it!

1156
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:01,890
Arrest him, fucking multiples.

1157
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:24,059
Tell the committee you are aiming
at the Creeper behind Marshal.

1158
01:20:24,071 --> 01:20:27,180
Otherwise you could
get permanently deleted.

1159
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:30,570
Fuck that shit.

1160
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,381
You really think Captain
Crane Pie is going to let us live?

1161
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:39,051
He's probably going to shoot us himself.

1162
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,580
He's a nutjob.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

1163
01:20:44,545 --> 01:20:46,786
He's the biggest, dumbest
nutjob out of all the Mickeys.

1164
01:20:47,265 --> 01:20:48,386
And that's saying something.

1165
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,040
You screwed my entire life up.

1166
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:55,130
Oh, really? We all got
fucked the minute you

1167
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:57,860
decided not to die and
came crawling home to me.

1168
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:01,200
That wasn't my fault.
That was the Creeper's fault.

1169
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,260
Creeper?

1170
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:07,083
Well, if that Creeper
is eating me like it's

1171
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,500
supposed to, then we
won't be in this situation.

1172
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:14,060
But they all kicked me out,
and I'm a goddamn multiple.

1173
01:21:15,505 --> 01:21:16,160
They kicked you out?

1174
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:17,420
Yeah.

1175
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:24,180
You're all pushing me and pulling me,
and they all threw me back into the snow.

1176
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:30,660
Maybe I didn't look tasty enough,
or smelled off. I don't know.

1177
01:21:32,905 --> 01:21:34,266
Maybe I was in some kind of sauce.

1178
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,460
Hold on. You're telling me they saved you?

1179
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,640
Think about it. You shouldn't have died
in that crevasse. The Creeper saved you.

1180
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:55,020
Uh, I guess if you put it like that,
uh, they were sort of saying me off.

1181
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:58,611
I mean, maybe I should have said thank you.

1182
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:03,400
Yeah. I don't think they
were going to eat you. Right?

1183
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,940
Oh, my God.

1184
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,081
We have to report this to science.
They saved humans.

1185
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,280
Yeah. People need to know this.

1186
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:14,880
They saved me.

1187
01:22:27,505 --> 01:22:30,306
Where's the fucking ladder?
You're supposed to bring a fucking ladder.

1188
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:31,490
I don't know.

1189
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,090
Here. Let me help.

1190
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,390
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Stop. I'll do it myself.

1191
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,650
I'm coming down myself. Get the fuck off.

1192
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:45,730
Come on.

1193
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,370
Hey, Timo. What are you doing here?

1194
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:52,490
Oh, wow. You two really are multiples, huh?

1195
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:54,130
But it's you.

1196
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,472
Yeah, I see it in that
schmuck face of yours.

1197
01:22:57,484 --> 01:22:59,390
You're the one that
gave me this. Right?

1198
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,450
Oopsie.

1199
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,110
Here you go, guys.
You guys must be starving.

1200
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:08,471
Thanks, man. I knew you'd be coming for us.

1201
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:11,670
What are you up to?

1202
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:14,210
What's all that?

1203
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,450
So, um, here's the thing.

1204
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:23,310
I need to shoot a video
and send it to Earth ASAP.

1205
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:25,830
Video? To Earth?

1206
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:29,630
Yeah. Um, it's for, uh...

1207
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,340
Darius Blank.

1208
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:34,510
Darius Blank? Who's that?

1209
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,070
I found this at my door today.

1210
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:43,210
It's written by hand.

1211
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:45,550
It's a beautiful handwriting.

1212
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,001
It's from Darius Blank's associate.

1213
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,130
Yeah. His associate.

1214
01:23:53,925 --> 01:23:56,370
I'm not kidding. His associate.

1215
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:59,511
You know what I mean? Like, of course.

1216
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:03,110
Of course the loan shark
of all fuckin' loan sharks

1217
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:05,130
would figure out a way
to send one of his guys

1218
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,030
to follow us all the way here to Niflheim.

1219
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,590
To where we are right now.

1220
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:12,026
That's like a million fuckin'
miles from the world out there.

1221
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:13,186
You know what I'm talking about?

1222
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:14,216
Do you know how far that is?

1223
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,190
No matter what pittance you
manage to scrape together,

1224
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:20,190
we've found that
sending it to Earth will cost

1225
01:24:20,191 --> 01:24:23,710
you an intergalactic
transfer fee more than...

1226
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,070
half the total sum.

1227
01:24:26,071 --> 01:24:27,071
God fucking associate!

1228
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,130
I have no idea who that is!

1229
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,210
I don't know who that is!

1230
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,080
Isn't that fucking crazy?

1231
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,370
Send a visual work of art.

1232
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,010
That's fucking crazy.

1233
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:39,630
A video file that captures
the details of death.

1234
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:41,550
Read the back.

1235
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:45,450
It says, chop up into a
minimum of 13 pieces.

1236
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:45,990
Chop up?

1237
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:46,950
Is that it?

1238
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:47,990
What the fuck is this?

1239
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,770
Hey! What did I say about the close-up?

1240
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:52,551
Close-up is more important, okay?

1241
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:55,821
So take the 32K camera
and put it over here for Mr.

1242
01:24:55,822 --> 01:24:56,770
Darius Blank.

1243
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:57,930
You understand?

1244
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:03,670
I'm sorry, Nicky.

1245
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:05,910
It's all there.

1246
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:07,430
Right? In the letter.

1247
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:11,570
If I shoot this video and I
send it to him, he'll let me live.

1248
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,320
If I don't,

1249
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,830
I'm gonna send that guy in.

1250
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,030
He's gonna kill me first.

1251
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,420
What am I supposed to do?

1252
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:25,990
Come on, dude. If I die, that's it for me.

1253
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,220
But you're expendable.

1254
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,771
They'll just print you right back out.

1255
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:32,010
Please.

1256
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:33,670
Nicky.

1257
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,050
I'm your friend.

1258
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:37,950
Okay?
Please do this for your friend one time.

1259
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:39,726
You gotta do this for me, man.

1260
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:40,750
I'm your brother.

1261
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:44,980
I'm sorry.

1262
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:48,620
I'm sorry.

1263
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:50,720
I'm so sorry.

1264
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:55,050
I'm so sorry.

1265
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,240
Oh, shit.

1266
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:59,231
I should've killed this guy
when I had the chance.

1267
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:02,540
You guys just do this for me this one time.

1268
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:03,710
That's all I'm asking.

1269
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:04,680
I'm so sorry.

1270
01:26:04,681 --> 01:26:05,880
Stop crying, you prick!

1271
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:08,440
I'm getting on my fucking nerves.

1272
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:12,636
Why don't you guys do
rock, paper, scissors, okay?

1273
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:14,340
And then we'll just shoot the loser, yeah?

1274
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:15,560
No.

1275
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:16,740
All right.

1276
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:17,880
Shoot him.

1277
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:19,060
Him?

1278
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,680
Yeah, him.

1279
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,140
I wasn't expecting that.

1280
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,060
I thought you'd choose him.

1281
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,996
Yeah, you'd think so,
but the soft one's easier.

1282
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:25,300
Come on.

1283
01:26:25,301 --> 01:26:26,301
Come on.

1284
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,730
You're a dumb fucking bitch, Timo.

1285
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:48,210
If you do this and what space lets you
live, you think that'll be the end of it?

1286
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,301
You don't think I'll tell you
to fuck in pieces myself?

1287
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:53,410
Oh, my God.

1288
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,440
What is the big deal?

1289
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,331
All right, just take me instead.

1290
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:58,150
What?

1291
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,910
Just chop me up, not him.

1292
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:04,930
Look at him.

1293
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,266
You shot him one time with the tager,

1294
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:10,170
it's like you just boofed a
fucking electric eel, man.

1295
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:14,370
But you can chop my whole
body up into ten mickey chunks,

1296
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:20,390
and I'll still be fresh as the
freshest sashimi, head held high.

1297
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:22,190
Theorists will love that.

1298
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:25,711
I just need a little of your help.

1299
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,030
My help?

1300
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:31,330
Can't I need more of that?

1301
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:33,910
Oxy's hopeful.

1302
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,830
Yeah, I got some oxy.

1303
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:38,900
But undiluted.

1304
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:41,910
You want...

1305
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:44,830
You want undiluted oxy right now?

1306
01:27:45,070 --> 01:27:46,070
Yeah.

1307
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,750
Just think of it as the, uh...

1308
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:55,970
Think of it as the final
cigarette before execution.

1309
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,621
It's the least you could do for a friend.

1310
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:03,910
Give him yours.

1311
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:04,610
What?

1312
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:05,310
Come on.

1313
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:06,210
No.

1314
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,706
I'll give you a freebie next time.

1315
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:08,730
You know me.

1316
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:11,750
This was expensive.

1317
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:19,660
The keys!

1318
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,840
Nasha!

1319
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,420
It's all mine.

1320
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:35,660
Do it!

1321
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:41,220
Nasha!

1322
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,460
What are you doing?

1323
01:28:44,505 --> 01:28:45,505
What's going on here?

1324
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:46,960
Nasha!

1325
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,180
Stay put.

1326
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:53,060
That did kind of shock me a bit.

1327
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:57,380
I mean, she literally was gonna
cut his head off with a chainsaw.

1328
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:03,500
Uh, but then I thought
about it and I was so touched.

1329
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,760
She's the only person who'd
ever lose it like that over me.

1330
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,440
And it wasn't the first time either.

1331
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:08,830
Nasha.

1332
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:11,630
She's the only one who's
always been there for me.

1333
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:14,170
She's always loved me.

1334
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:16,690
Every me.

1335
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:18,910
Even him.

1336
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:21,850
The me I don't understand at all.

1337
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:23,910
What is this?

1338
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:25,230
Oh, you don't know about this.

1339
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:27,031
They've been circling the whole night.

1340
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:28,490
And still more coming in.

1341
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:29,630
What are they doing?

1342
01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:30,710
We don't know.

1343
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,770
They can break through solid ice and stone.

1344
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:34,630
Imagine if they all come from this ship.

1345
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:35,290
Terrifying!

1346
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:37,731
But you couldn't even tear
through the sack at the cafeteria.

1347
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:40,270
You hear that?

1348
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:42,341
It's coming from the one
we captured yesterday.

1349
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,230
Keep going, keep going.

1350
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:44,370
Wait, you mean the baby?

1351
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:45,370
Well, yeah.

1352
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,210
It's been screaming and crying like one.

1353
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,321
And that's when they all started gathering.

1354
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,640
That was... That was the
one that I... Keep going.

1355
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,100
Never mind.

1356
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:01,700
Hi.

1357
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,320
How you doing?

1358
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,700
Excuse me!

1359
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,280
Come up.

1360
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:07,860
Somebody passing through?

1361
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,040
Hey.

1362
01:31:09,041 --> 01:31:11,400
Why did they set up
the situation room there?

1363
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:11,920
Beats me.

1364
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,416
I was just told to bring the prisoner.

1365
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,880
Apparently, Otha made a big scene.

1366
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,220
She wants the creeper now.

1367
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,860
Darby, I have crucial
information about the creepers.

1368
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:21,636
McGee needs to file an official
report with the head of science.

1369
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:22,660
Oh, wait.

1370
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,200
Yes, I knew it.

1371
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,900
Yesterday, at the cafeteria when
you held on to the baby, I saw it.

1372
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,100
You saw that?

1373
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:42,576
I don't know what it means, though.

1374
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:42,980
Oh.

1375
01:31:42,981 --> 01:31:43,100
What?

1376
01:31:43,425 --> 01:31:44,506
So you were just imitating?

1377
01:31:44,545 --> 01:31:46,320
Well, originally... No offense.

1378
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,000
What's the matter?

1379
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:48,660
It's really hectic right now.

1380
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:49,780
Let's talk later.

1381
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,940
We're recording the sounds to see
if we can analyze any kind of pattern.

1382
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:56,620
The committee is declaring
a level three emergency.

1383
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,288
Sole command and
control has been granted

1384
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,640
to Commander Marshall
by a vote of 36 to 21.

1385
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,060
Thank you.

1386
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,620
What an event.

1387
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:10,700
This is a truly novel ingredient.

1388
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:15,020
This opens up a whole new
world of potential sauces.

1389
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,100
It's such a great... how should I put it?

1390
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:20,050
Opportunity, ma'am.

1391
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,480
Yes, quite the opportunity.

1392
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Just super.

1393
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,660
Yes, it is a super opportunity.

1394
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,630
Oh, wow.

1395
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,850
It's such a godsend, too.

1396
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,691
It is free from harmful pathogens, correct?

1397
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:40,610
Yes, ma'am.

1398
01:32:40,611 --> 01:32:41,611
Sure.

1399
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,420
Which dickhead is it, Mickey 18?

1400
01:33:05,130 --> 01:33:06,130
Keep his head still!

1401
01:33:11,365 --> 01:33:12,980
Now I can tell you to a punch.

1402
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:14,420
Filthy multiples.

1403
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,100
Oh, yeah.

1404
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:16,480
That does seem fair.

1405
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:17,660
Oh, goodness.

1406
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,900
Bright meat.

1407
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:20,180
That's nothing, honey.

1408
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:23,160
Wait till these two are
scorched sausages in the cyclo.

1409
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,140
How are you going to handle that stench?

1410
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,260
Mickey.

1411
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,020
I'm so sorry.

1412
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:31,900
You too.

1413
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:33,740
This brick stores your memories, right?

1414
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,860
Now you'll watch as I permanently
delete your being from it.

1415
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:41,120
That way you'll understand
the meaning and terror of finality.

1416
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:42,800
No more reprints!

1417
01:33:43,315 --> 01:33:45,436
That's what you both should
be thinking when you die.

1418
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,620
Dead forever!

1419
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,820
Now that the memory is
gone, which body goes first?

1420
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:52,480
One of the times, twice the fun.

1421
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:54,080
Creepy.

1422
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,340
Commander Marshall, sir.

1423
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:57,900
May I say a few words?

1424
01:33:58,515 --> 01:34:00,740
Regardless of who burns
first, the simple fact is...

1425
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:03,151
we currently have two
Mickeys here before us.

1426
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:05,531
Due to no fault on their part, I might add.

1427
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:08,440
One of them is being falsely
accused of firing his gun at you.

1428
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,010
But the truth is...

1429
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:12,391
he was concerned for your safety.

1430
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:16,536
He was the first to notice the second
Creeper coming out of the stone behind you.

1431
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:20,501
And as you are well aware, the day
an expendable is printed... Enough!

1432
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:24,280
You, defending these idiots,
should be mopping up your own shit.

1433
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:26,100
Illegal possession of oxyzophil.

1434
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,611
Concealment of a multiples violation.

1435
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:29,320
It's disappointing.

1436
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,770
An attempted murder
without... fucking chainsaw?

1437
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:35,556
I mean, it's quite the colorful rap
sheet, don't you think, Miss Barrage?

1438
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,480
The clouds of war are billowing.

1439
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,160
Look at those vermin swarmed.

1440
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,220
Mankind must unite
at this critical juncture.

1441
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,920
Why are we wasting our time
with these dregs of society?

1442
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:47,660
Spoken like a true wartime commander, sir.

1443
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,400
Very impressive.

1444
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:53,640
And a fine entry to add to your
collection of battle quotes, if I may.

1445
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:54,300
You like that?

1446
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:54,680
I do.

1447
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:55,500
More of that?

1448
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:56,100
Please.

1449
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,281
You keep mentioning
that we're in a state of war.

1450
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:01,991
May I be so bold as to
offer two observations, sir?

1451
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:03,520
Be my guest.

1452
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:08,060
Firstly, fighting a war requires a
huge amount of energy and calories.

1453
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,087
Seeing as we're in
the early stages of

1454
01:35:11,099 --> 01:35:12,961
settlement and our
survival is in the balance,

1455
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,281
I wonder whether this
expenditure is prudent.

1456
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,920
Secondly, our apparent
enemies are the Creepers.

1457
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:21,986
But do we know whether they
actually want to engage in war?

1458
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,881
For hours they've been swirling
in circles doing nothing but wailing.

1459
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,900
My God, Agent Verge.

1460
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:33,720
You used to be a five-time
Marshall Cup champion.

1461
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,580
Agent of the Month.

1462
01:35:36,555 --> 01:35:40,820
And now you're sweating
over these alien insects?

1463
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,340
How far you've fallen.

1464
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:48,151
What are you going to do when they tear
a hole in this ship and tear off your ass?

1465
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,100
These grotesque shit gibbons.

1466
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:54,740
Grotesque or not, they are the
native inhabitants of this planet.

1467
01:35:55,825 --> 01:35:57,620
And we have proof that
they saved one of us.

1468
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:00,100
They didn't eat him or attack him.

1469
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,600
Saved and not eaten who?

1470
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:03,960
Uh, me.

1471
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:07,320
They saved me.

1472
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,100
Of course they didn't eat you.

1473
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:15,310
You're crap food.

1474
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,820
You're recycled spam, baby.

1475
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,280
You get chewed up and shit
out over and over and over again.

1476
01:36:22,281 --> 01:36:24,281
Well, I guess they aren't
just stupid bugs, honey.

1477
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:25,640
I mean, they knew to pass on crap.

1478
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:26,460
Junk.

1479
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,660
They must have some cognitive ability.

1480
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,880
Exactly.

1481
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:33,280
Actually, they exhibit
signs of high intelligence.

1482
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:35,820
They may be able to engage
in meaningful conversation.

1483
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:38,200
And we're analyzing this and...

1484
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,680
Sir?

1485
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:43,691
You must try communicating
with them yourself.

1486
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:46,980
We're developing a sort of translator.

1487
01:36:49,695 --> 01:36:50,840
Like that, you mean?

1488
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:52,990
You think I'm an idiot?

1489
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,640
Oh, fuck.

1490
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:15,088
Four and a half years
across the fucking galaxy

1491
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,660
just to hear these
goddamn alien squawks?

1492
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,780
Tell me how the fuck that
makes any sense, somebody?

1493
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,040
How does this make any sense?

1494
01:37:25,395 --> 01:37:26,916
How does your bullshit make any sense?

1495
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,496
You know, your fucking fuckface is what
really doesn't make any fucking sense.

1496
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,520
You fucking...

1497
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:32,625
IDIOT!

1498
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:34,610
You call them aliens?

1499
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,540
We're the aliens, dumbass!

1500
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:37,856
They would have been here before us.

1501
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,880
And Mickey...

1502
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:41,760
Mickey was always just Mickey Barnes.

1503
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:44,491
Do you even understand what that means?

1504
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:49,060
They were just living their lives
before you came in with your bullshit!

1505
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:52,240
And you think you get to
decide who lives and who dies?

1506
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,860
You are a dumb fuck!

1507
01:37:56,845 --> 01:37:59,460
No wonder you blew the
elections, you fucking moron.

1508
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:19,920
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1509
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:21,150
God, hang up!

1510
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,360
Bite.

1511
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:34,380
What?

1512
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:37,540
Falling in three, two, one.

1513
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:46,750
Fine, as you shut the fuck up.

1514
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,270
This is clearly abuse,
one kiss after the other.

1515
01:38:55,210 --> 01:38:56,210
Rolling.

1516
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:00,310
In the 32K.

1517
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:03,701
Make sure you get everything.

1518
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:04,930
Impressive teeth.

1519
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:06,150
Yeah.

1520
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:07,410
We need more of our guys.

1521
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:12,990
Sir, now might be the prime
time to initiate total extermination.

1522
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:15,531
The ones out there alone
would be more than enough.

1523
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,830
What are you talking about?

1524
01:39:17,455 --> 01:39:19,336
We're gonna gas them,
we're gonna gas them all.

1525
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:22,790
What's that look for?

1526
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:25,210
Still not confident in your failures?

1527
01:39:25,211 --> 01:39:26,510
No, no, sir.

1528
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:30,170
Arcadi 3.0 has gone through
several meticulous stages of testing.

1529
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:32,790
Arcadi 3.0 is the ultimate nerve gas.

1530
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:34,790
I have every confidence in it, sir.

1531
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:36,130
As you should, Arcadi.

1532
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:37,150
This has to succeed.

1533
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,121
I'll put it in my prayers.

1534
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:41,830
This is the day we've
been waiting for, sir.

1535
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:45,271
Future historians will
mark today as error-defining

1536
01:39:45,283 --> 01:39:47,630
for cleansing dangerous
species on colony planets.

1537
01:39:48,445 --> 01:39:50,326
Why don't you board
the flitter yourself later?

1538
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:52,246
You mean when we spray the gas?

1539
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:53,270
Yeah.

1540
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:54,710
I pull the trigger?

1541
01:39:54,711 --> 01:39:55,790
Exactly, sir.

1542
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,010
If you write the leaf flitter and
appear to commandeer the operation,

1543
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:02,970
the footage I get, it will be historic.

1544
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:07,770
And the members, the church
members back on Earth, they will adore it.

1545
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:09,390
Yes, yes, the company.

1546
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:10,790
All right.

1547
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,790
It's time we initiate
Operation Total Extermination.

1548
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:15,326
Honey, can I have a word with you?

1549
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:16,350
Yes, my love.

1550
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:18,310
I've got an idea.

1551
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,690
I hope you both can appreciate what a
great honor my wife has bestowed on me.

1552
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:26,470
I'm going to be storing
on your shit stains.

1553
01:40:26,805 --> 01:40:29,250
And so I can press both
buttons simultaneously?

1554
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:30,650
Yes, sir.

1555
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,566
Press them and they'll
go off at the same time.

1556
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:35,790
They'll also explode automatically if
they exit the range of the remote control.

1557
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:36,550
You hear that?

1558
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:37,630
I have you by the balls.

1559
01:40:37,685 --> 01:40:38,965
Don't even think of running off.

1560
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:41,246
You'll each be given a primitive
weapon as you head out.

1561
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:43,714
You cut off as many creeper
tails as you can, and the

1562
01:40:43,726 --> 01:40:46,090
first Mickey to bring back
100 tails is the winner.

1563
01:40:46,795 --> 01:40:47,876
And the winner doesn't die.

1564
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:49,730
But the loser goes...

1565
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:51,650
Boom!

1566
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:52,090
Boom!

1567
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:52,690
Boom.

1568
01:40:52,691 --> 01:40:53,691
Boom.

1569
01:40:53,935 --> 01:40:55,330
A world keeps going from here.

1570
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:58,273
Your job is to make
them scream so loudly that

1571
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:01,050
every last creeper comes
running in to save them.

1572
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:03,710
We'll kill two birds with
one stone, right honey?

1573
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:07,250
Oh, absolutely. 100 tails is enough to
make enough sauce to last a couple years.

1574
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:08,790
Better be on your toes.

1575
01:41:09,915 --> 01:41:11,610
One false move and you're man burger.

1576
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:29,110
It's all punishment.

1577
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:32,070
What was that?

1578
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:37,890
My entire life's a goddamn punishment.

1579
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:40,590
All for pressing that
button when I was five.

1580
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:43,750
Oh, this again.

1581
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:48,650
Accident was caused by a
car defect, you know that?

1582
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:50,850
I don't know.

1583
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:58,030
Well, it wasn't pressing
that stupid button.

1584
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:01,710
It wasn't while I was driving either.

1585
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:04,690
How many times I gotta tell you?

1586
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:10,190
Sorry, Mickey.

1587
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:12,790
Mickey, you need to move. Like, now.

1588
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,010
Can you at least put the ramp down?

1589
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:16,730
We can't do that right now. I'm sorry.

1590
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:17,990
You're gonna have to drive.

1591
01:42:17,991 --> 01:42:18,991
What?

1592
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:22,050
Mickey!

1593
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:29,420
Take this.

1594
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:33,296
It's not finished, but it might help
you communicate with the Creepers.

1595
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:33,560
Let's go.

1596
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:35,760
Is this like a translator thing?

1597
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:37,020
Yes. Good luck.

1598
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,220
For what it's worth, I doubt
Marshall will kill both of you.

1599
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,280
Come on.

1600
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:42,580
Come on.

1601
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:45,581
Well, I... Go.

1602
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:55,870
With this device, I got a job to do.

1603
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:58,830
All right.

1604
01:42:58,950 --> 01:43:01,650
They saved me. Now I save them.

1605
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:04,070
What are those fuckers doing?

1606
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:05,810
Even I can count.

1607
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:07,841
Dozens of fresh tails
they're leaving behind.

1608
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:09,090
Are they out of their minds?

1609
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:10,930
Oh, honey.

1610
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,730
Should I just press the button?

1611
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:14,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1612
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,970
Let's sit back and watch.

1613
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:21,164
They'll start chopping
tails as soon as they

1614
01:43:21,176 --> 01:43:23,310
realize one of them
has to outlive the other.

1615
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:25,490
Hey!

1616
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:26,850
Hey!

1617
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,250
It's me!

1618
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:31,800
You gotta run away!

1619
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:34,120
You gotta get them all out of here!

1620
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,300
You gotta go back to your cave!

1621
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,880
Go back to your cave!

1622
01:43:43,665 --> 01:43:45,100
Or you're all gonna die.

1623
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:48,740
What?

1624
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,080
Oh, hello.

1625
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,960
Um...

1626
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:55,520
Yes, I just... I wanted...

1627
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,220
About last time, I...

1628
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,100
Uh...

1629
01:43:59,480 --> 01:43:59,760
I...

1630
01:44:00,085 --> 01:44:01,340
I wanted to say...

1631
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:02,940
Thank you.

1632
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:04,620
Um...

1633
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,080
Do you remember me right?

1634
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:10,560
Mickey.

1635
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:12,760
Uh...

1636
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:15,200
How do you know my name?

1637
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,040
Cigarette.

1638
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:22,961
Wait, are they having a conversation?

1639
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,740
Yes.

1640
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:27,800
We already explained it just now.

1641
01:44:27,801 --> 01:44:28,140
How?

1642
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,320
How is this possible?

1643
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:34,340
Oh, well, it's still a prototype,
but it's like a translator device.

1644
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,160
Dor... Dorothy?

1645
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:37,880
Oh, no, where's Dorothy?

1646
01:44:38,795 --> 01:44:40,436
I can't hear a thing with all the static.

1647
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,720
I mean, even the video is shit!

1648
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:48,381
Apologies, sir. The snowstorm is exacerbating
the absorption... What about this?

1649
01:44:48,805 --> 01:44:49,805
Will this detonator work?

1650
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:52,920
Yes, sir. That is a special
shortwave signal, so it'll be fine.

1651
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,120
And who's that big one there?

1652
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:56,461
Is that the queen bee of the bunch?

1653
01:44:56,485 --> 01:44:58,860
Hmm, looks like a croissant dipped in shit.

1654
01:45:00,065 --> 01:45:03,086
Uh, official reports
are still being finalized,

1655
01:45:03,098 --> 01:45:06,260
but we think everything
revolves around that one.

1656
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,740
The mama creeper.

1657
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,180
So that one's the boss. Like you.

1658
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:13,220
Say what?

1659
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:18,720
We gotta get out of here, or they're
gonna kill you all with this death gas.

1660
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:24,560
That gas, Arcadi 3.0,
I got blasted with that.

1661
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,600
It's seriously...

1662
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:27,500
...insanely painful.

1663
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,900
Do you know what gas is? Gas?

1664
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:33,740
Like...

1665
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,040
...like gas?

1666
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:42,400
Mind your own business, stupid.

1667
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,240
Mind my own business? What about you?

1668
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,640
Why'd you save him at the cave?

1669
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,500
Should kill him?

1670
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,920
No!

1671
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,360
No!

1672
01:45:56,820 --> 01:46:00,500
I'm... ...we're very
grateful. That's all.

1673
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:02,300
Then why?

1674
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:06,740
Why kill Luko?

1675
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:10,060
Uh... ...Luko?

1676
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:14,740
Baby...Luko.

1677
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,160
Oh.

1678
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,540
You grew.

1679
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,120
Shattered.

1680
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,500
Blood.

1681
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:26,840
Yeah, uh...

1682
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:28,540
...oh, that's, uh...

1683
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:30,620
...that's Luko.

1684
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:33,860
We save you.

1685
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,760
You kill Luko.

1686
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,520
So what's the name of the other baby?

1687
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:48,250
The one on the ship?

1688
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:50,760
Zuko.

1689
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,760
Kill Zuko, too.

1690
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,620
What if Zuko dies? What will you do?

1691
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:03,580
Death.

1692
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:05,620
All.

1693
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:10,770
You mean all humans.

1694
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:16,940
Extinction!

1695
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:18,300
How?

1696
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:21,360
Easy.

1697
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:10,430
Unless somebody
wants to kill me.

1698
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:14,070
Desperate.

1699
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:15,431
Dusko.

1700
01:48:45,091 --> 01:48:49,010
уль What's wrong with them? What's wrong
with him? And they're saying something.

1701
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:52,630
What is that idiot saying?
It's not sign language.

1702
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:07,510
C3? C3? What's C3?

1703
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:20,310
Bring the baby! Bring the baby!

1704
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:26,844
Honey, this doesn't sit
well with me. Why are those

1705
01:49:26,856 --> 01:49:30,650
two losers chatting with
the boss of the bugs?

1706
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:33,611
They think they're negotiating
on behalf of mankind, humankind?

1707
01:49:34,215 --> 01:49:35,736
You should be standing out there, sir.

1708
01:49:36,405 --> 01:49:38,370
Ushering in this historic moment.

1709
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:44,670
You're seeing two bosses meeting
face to face in a climactic snowstorm?

1710
01:49:44,790 --> 01:49:45,790
A moment of destiny?

1711
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:47,791
All you have to do is go out there.

1712
01:49:48,195 --> 01:49:49,750
I know I can create an iconic scene.

1713
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:53,130
A decisive moment in the
history of the Niflheim settlement.

1714
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:55,610
Oh, I can picture it now.

1715
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,790
Adorning the ceiling and
the walls of the Grand Chapel.

1716
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,170
Yes, ma'am. Yes.

1717
01:50:01,705 --> 01:50:02,910
One final touch, sir.

1718
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:07,330
I think it would be great if you give
them a message before spraying the gas.

1719
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:08,630
A message?

1720
01:50:09,345 --> 01:50:12,018
Without such poignancy,
today will be a third-rate

1721
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:15,090
carnival where we spray cheap
pesticide over cockroaches.

1722
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:20,730
Yes, they are disgusting, filthy, evil
insects, but it will be their last moment.

1723
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,910
And you could offer them a few
merciful words as a proper farewell.

1724
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,790
Like a wise, benevolent priest.

1725
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:31,970
Get me a camera crew. Tell the
first squad to meet me fully armed.

1726
01:50:31,971 --> 01:50:32,530
Yes, sir.

1727
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,730
My love, the Situation Room is yours.

1728
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:35,990
Till we meet again?

1729
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:41,580
C-3!

1730
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:43,040
Not who you want to meet.

1731
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,220
It's the wrong thing.

1732
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:47,100
I want to get Sokol back safe.

1733
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,360
I mean it!

1734
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:51,900
Not enough.

1735
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,600
But what else?

1736
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:57,920
We lose Luko.

1737
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,720
One.

1738
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:02,940
Be fair.

1739
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:05,300
Be fair?

1740
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:07,340
And we have to contribute to death?

1741
01:51:09,110 --> 01:51:10,110
Yes.

1742
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,940
Fair.

1743
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,300
One of yours.

1744
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:16,340
Die.

1745
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:19,960
So if we bring back Sokol
safe, and a human dies?

1746
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,050
Peace.

1747
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:26,620
Peace.

1748
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,660
Peace.

1749
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:57,680
Do you copy?

1750
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,852
Okay, the radio signal is
a little patched right now,

1751
01:52:00,853 --> 01:52:03,520
so the comms speaker will
be on the right line of comms.

1752
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:05,180
Units, who do you copy?

1753
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:09,300
Our orders are to send you a
score for under-martial... Die!

1754
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:11,340
I'm not going to dance!

1755
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:14,020
Do not entertain the queen!

1756
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:15,140
Die!

1757
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,480
I'm down.

1758
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,557
Okay, right after your speech,
sir, we'll close the canopy

1759
01:52:28,558 --> 01:52:31,061
at once, and that will be
the signal for the air squad.

1760
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,320
Spray that gas.

1761
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:34,880
Glorious annihilation, sir.

1762
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:38,100
You.

1763
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:38,780
Yes, you.

1764
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:39,120
Come here.

1765
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:39,560
What's your name?

1766
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:39,860
Matthew?

1767
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:40,540
Oh, Matthew.

1768
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:41,820
You have the face of an angel.

1769
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,020
Here.

1770
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:43,300
Try my socks.

1771
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:44,940
Here you go.

1772
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,240
Tell me what you think.

1773
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:47,680
No!

1774
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,160
No!

1775
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:49,600
No!

1776
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:50,900
No!

1777
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:51,600
No!

1778
01:52:51,601 --> 01:52:51,740
No!

1779
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:53,280
No!

1780
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:58,480
No!

1781
01:52:58,481 --> 01:52:59,481
No!

1782
01:52:59,520 --> 01:52:59,660
No!

1783
01:52:59,661 --> 01:53:00,661
Take it easy.

1784
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,020
One snap and it's instant death.

1785
01:53:07,190 --> 01:53:08,880
Nasha Barrage, what do you want?

1786
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:11,640
The baby.

1787
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,800
We have to take it to the moment.

1788
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:14,640
That's all?

1789
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:15,860
Yes.

1790
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,480
Guarantee us a safe exit.

1791
01:53:18,690 --> 01:53:20,331
Unless you want to see me break her neck.

1792
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:22,340
No.

1793
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,720
Nasha, please don't.

1794
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:26,700
Look, we secure Nasha's exit as negotiated.

1795
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,040
Nasha, can you release her carefully?

1796
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:32,940
Let me get the baby.

1797
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:33,980
Be careful.

1798
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:35,560
Nasha, are you okay?

1799
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,040
I need to hurry.

1800
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,560
Can I get a flitter?

1801
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:38,160
I doubt it.

1802
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:39,180
You'll have to run.

1803
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:51,200
Ma'am, today you and the
commander have displayed

1804
01:53:51,212 --> 01:53:54,720
an impressive range
of verbal and physical

1805
01:53:54,721 --> 01:53:58,220
abuse and acts of cruelty that
far exceed your granted authority.

1806
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:00,240
You want to be executed for mutiny?

1807
01:54:00,845 --> 01:54:04,080
All video evidence of abuse will be
presented to the committee for review.

1808
01:54:04,810 --> 01:54:06,931
I suggest you have answers
prepared for your hearing.

1809
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:08,300
Thanks, Zeke.

1810
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:11,480
Maintain control on site.

1811
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:15,300
Here!

1812
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:32,610
We'll start slowly circling
the creature from the outside...

1813
01:54:32,611 --> 01:54:35,510
Making the scene
absolutely spectacular, sir.

1814
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:39,790
I'll keep my speech short and tight.

1815
01:54:40,710 --> 01:54:43,770
A marvelous address, no need to add it.

1816
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:46,270
And then I'll blow off the mickeys.

1817
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:47,650
Pokemon Go!

1818
01:54:47,651 --> 01:54:51,070
You can do this, Nachi.
We'll get things under control inside.

1819
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:53,810
Okay. See ya.

1820
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:54,950
Good luck!

1821
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:03,260
Nachi's gonna figure this all out.

1822
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:04,680
His own will be back, you see.

1823
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:07,120
Who is that?

1824
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:09,140
Who's coming?

1825
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:46,880
Wait.

1826
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,540
What is this bullshit?

1827
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:52,540
Which one's your mama?

1828
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:58,020
What the fuck am I supposed to be
looking at when I make my speech?

1829
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:02,480
I was gonna send them off with some dinghy!

1830
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:05,780
Now a barbarian can fuck off!

1831
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,520
Is that bazooka ready?

1832
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:10,180
Yes, sir. Loading now.

1833
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:13,560
We're gonna blast that
mama bitch into oblivion.

1834
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,500
We need to fucking speed.

1835
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:18,220
I'll go hard.

1836
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,360
That's the mama there, sir!

1837
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:21,120
Can you see it?

1838
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,460
That's a different shit!

1839
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:24,220
Yes, it's her!

1840
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,620
It's not her death!

1841
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:30,320
Sorry, sir.

1842
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:37,620
McKay!

1843
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:40,120
Naza!

1844
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:41,820
Naza!

1845
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,960
Come to say goodbye.

1846
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:12,600
What?

1847
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:13,920
Jesus Christ!

1848
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,460
I knew you would make it!

1849
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:14,960
Is the baby okay?

1850
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:16,860
Look!

1851
01:59:09,865 --> 01:59:10,865
You're also afraid.

1852
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:19,740
Yeah, I'm afraid.

1853
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:21,730
I need you, human.

1854
01:59:23,650 --> 01:59:24,690
You're important.

1855
01:59:27,085 --> 01:59:28,130
Come to me, my boy.

1856
02:00:13,650 --> 02:00:21,650
Okay, guys!

1857
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:23,310
Guys!

1858
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:24,910
Don't be shy.

1859
02:00:24,990 --> 02:00:26,670
Sit down, take your seats.

1860
02:00:27,405 --> 02:00:29,610
The groundbreaking
ceremony will come later.

1861
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:31,450
But we'll start with the expendable stuff.

1862
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:34,330
Mickey, come up to the front, mate.

1863
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:37,930
Can someone please sit on the
front row, you fucking introverts.

1864
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:46,120
Hello everyone.

1865
02:00:47,170 --> 02:00:48,891
I'm Nasha Barrage, member of the committee.

1866
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:55,480
After weeks of debate, we have
finally come to this momentous day.

1867
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,960
The day we abolish the
Expendables Programme.

1868
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:02,651
I would like to thank my fellow
committee members for their support.

1869
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:04,820
I've been really feeling the love.

1870
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:07,800
And especially for
fighting right to the end

1871
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:12,320
and persuading the committee to
permanently abolish human printing.

1872
02:01:13,740 --> 02:01:17,200
I would like to thank our
very own Mickey Barnes.

1873
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:22,240
And to be fair, I'm just so fucking
happy I get to grow old with Mickey.

1874
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,240
I was really stuck in
getting old by myself.

1875
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:26,100
Okay.

1876
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:28,840
Alright.

1877
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:32,270
So you hit the button.

1878
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:33,420
Wait.

1879
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:35,411
Nasha will give the signal.

1880
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:36,640
You hit the button.

1881
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:37,220
Wait.

1882
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:38,490
And then over there...

1883
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,180
Do I get up and press it or...?

1884
02:01:41,555 --> 02:01:42,555
No, in my seat, right?

1885
02:01:42,905 --> 02:01:44,640
I honestly couldn't give a fuck.

1886
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:49,580
Henceforth, on Niflheim, as on Earth,

1887
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,700
human printing is now
permanently abolished.

1888
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:59,760
Here today, the human
printer will be burnt to ashes

1889
02:02:00,945 --> 02:02:02,000
and erased from memory.

1890
02:02:03,330 --> 02:02:04,440
Nasha's such a natural.

1891
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:07,771
I think she could even run for
committee chair next election.

1892
02:02:08,505 --> 02:02:10,760
It blows my mind still to
think that this amazing woman

1893
02:02:10,761 --> 02:02:14,840
just six months ago was riding
with the rest of us in that shitty prison.

1894
02:02:17,890 --> 02:02:19,500
The day Marshall got blown to dust,

1895
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:22,560
Ilfa went into shock and
was taken to the psych ward.

1896
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,740
Rumors went around that
she slit her wrists there.

1897
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:28,700
And everyone else
involved was shoved into jail

1898
02:02:28,701 --> 02:02:31,480
and somehow lucky Timo
squeezes out on parole.

1899
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,680
But as soon as he got out, he
spent every day dreading the moment

1900
02:02:36,681 --> 02:02:39,121
he'd come face to face with
the man who delivered the letter.

1901
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,820
The associate of Darius Blank.

1902
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:44,820
Who one day finally jumped him.

1903
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,380
It was a fight to the death.

1904
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:54,380
In the end, the associate became a...

1905
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:56,280
cyclosoup.

1906
02:02:58,630 --> 02:02:59,630
Except for one ear.

1907
02:03:02,190 --> 02:03:05,020
Even at the trial, Timo
chooses to represent himself.

1908
02:03:07,365 --> 02:03:10,920
As he had his grip on me, he brought his
knife around to my midsection right here.

1909
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:13,160
And he sliced...
And he got released.

1910
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:14,781
...took him...
...on self-defense.

1911
02:03:15,735 --> 02:03:16,735
Classic Timo.

1912
02:03:17,665 --> 02:03:20,620
But our trials, on the other
hand, were never-ending.

1913
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:26,000
It became a whole political
fight between all the pro-marshals

1914
02:03:26,610 --> 02:03:28,260
and the anti-marshals.

1915
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:31,220
But by then, Nasha had made up her mind.

1916
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:34,540
She'd overhauled the
committee and changed it herself.

1917
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,340
So after she got out, she
really did run in the election.

1918
02:03:39,925 --> 02:03:41,500
And she won in a landslide.

1919
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:47,600
On her first day in the assembly,
Nasha was so cool about the whole thing.

1920
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:52,300
I was very, very nervous.

1921
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:55,101
I don't think she really noticed, though.

1922
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:58,060
Nikki?

1923
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:00,101
I got the upgraded translator.

1924
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,200
It just came out.

1925
02:04:05,025 --> 02:04:06,025
Okay, let's be fair.

1926
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:07,340
Can I ask you a question?

1927
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,320
Go.

1928
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:15,060
You said before about
extinction and all that.

1929
02:04:16,110 --> 02:04:17,240
When you're all like...

1930
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:20,880
...and, like, screeching and everything.

1931
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:24,180
Mmm...

1932
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:28,040
...would that really
make our brains explode?

1933
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:30,360
From, like, the pitch?

1934
02:04:33,460 --> 02:04:34,460
Explode.

1935
02:04:35,555 --> 02:04:40,440
But you said that our
eyeballs would explode.

1936
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:42,940
Mmm...

1937
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:44,560
...why not our eardrums?

1938
02:04:45,590 --> 02:04:47,160
Because it's, like, sound.

1939
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,700
All I explode.

1940
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:53,840
Really?

1941
02:04:55,275 --> 02:04:56,400
Can you try it right here?

1942
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:57,460
Right now?

1943
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:16,730
Who said bluffing was only for humans?

1944
02:05:18,070 --> 02:05:20,010
Gotta love that, uh, poker face.

1945
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:23,350
Yeah, and, uh, nice burp, too.

1946
02:06:29,530 --> 02:06:30,530
Uh, hello?

1947
02:06:31,910 --> 02:06:32,910
What are you doing here?

1948
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:34,851
In the middle of the night?

1949
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:38,400
Well, I just, uh...

1950
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:40,440
...I thought you were in the hospital.

1951
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:41,360
Hey, watch it.

1952
02:06:41,361 --> 02:06:42,361
Look down.

1953
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:43,980
Don't step on it.

1954
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:49,201
It's a priceless delicacy, Bab.

1955
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:51,060
Go on.

1956
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:52,180
Take a dab.

1957
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:53,420
Have a taste.

1958
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:57,540
A what?

1959
02:06:57,930 --> 02:06:59,691
Now you're too good
for sauce off the floor?

1960
02:07:00,375 --> 02:07:03,496
You think anyone else would allow scum
like you to taste something so refined?

1961
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:05,200
What is...

1962
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:07,630
...what is it made of?

1963
02:07:07,660 --> 02:07:08,660
Rude.

1964
02:07:08,835 --> 02:07:09,835
Not how it works.

1965
02:07:10,570 --> 02:07:12,440
A taste of faith comes first.

1966
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:14,061
Then I tell you what's in it.

1967
02:07:14,570 --> 02:07:16,757
Mickey, you don't think
I'm letting you taste this

1968
02:07:16,769 --> 02:07:18,880
out of some high regard
for your palate, do you?

1969
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:20,340
It's the opposite.

1970
02:07:21,055 --> 02:07:23,702
A true masterpiece would
be a sauce that could

1971
02:07:23,714 --> 02:07:26,200
appeal to even an
ignorant cretin like you.

1972
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:35,480
Whatever.

1973
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:37,561
Fuck it. Taste it. Waste it. I don't care.

1974
02:07:37,710 --> 02:07:38,710
You're worthless now.

1975
02:07:39,410 --> 02:07:41,680
Much better to bring back my usual taster.

1976
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:45,140
The supreme one with
an actually refined palate.

1977
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:50,140
Wait. That's...

1978
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:54,380
Even his kidneys are
more handsome than you.

1979
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:00,660
Not this. It can't be.

1980
02:08:04,340 --> 02:08:05,900
Of course it can.

1981
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:08,600
Admit it. It's what you want.

1982
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:11,000
It's what everyone wants.

1983
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:15,420
Hey, Ilfa.

1984
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:18,720
I just remembered.

1985
02:08:22,620 --> 02:08:23,820
You died...

1986
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,080
...the day after Marshall.

1987
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:48,100
Go ahead. Touch me.

1988
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:52,440
See if I'm ghost or human.

1989
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:00,830
Ever since I was a kid,
I've had scary dreams.

1990
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:03,390
This time I wasn't scared.

1991
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:08,170
I just thought to myself, what would 18 do?

1992
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:11,310
Fuck off.

1993
02:09:12,910 --> 02:09:14,550
What are you doing? Press the button.

1994
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:16,650
Mickey, press it.

1995
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:30,310
I am glad the printer's gone.

1996
02:09:30,570 --> 02:09:33,291
But a part of me can't
help feeling guilty that I

1997
02:09:33,303 --> 02:09:36,370
didn't let all the other
Mickeys have a chance at life.

1998
02:09:36,985 --> 02:09:38,890
But I have to stop feeling guilty.

1999
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:42,350
It's okay for me to be happy.
